Boko Haram was proscribed.”</p><p>The AGF noted that the “good results” arising from outlawing IPOB and Boko Haram buoyed the government to consider the proscription of bandits, and the use of military hardware against the marauders.</p><p>He said, “Now, we are confronted with another threat in the North-West associated with banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and in all these, these people are using weapons to attack Nigerians, kidnap them and created a situation of serious security challenge and fear in the system.</p><p>“Whatever military hardware you acquire there are limits within the context of the international convention as to how it can be used when it can be used and against who it can be used. And that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers come into being.</p><p>“Our assessment taking into consideration that they are causing a major threat to the territorial peaceful co-existence and causing a major threat to lives with weapons, the idea then came about that indeed they (bandits) have satisfied the criteria of being declared terrorists within the context of the law so that whatever military hardware at the disposal of the Federal Government can best be used against them within the context of the international convention and within the context of the law.”</p><p>Malami while speaking on why his office has not acted on the court order declaring bandits as terrorists said, “The gazetting of a court order or judgement is a process but what matters fundamentally within the context of the international convention is the judicial declaration and that has been obtained; the court has declared bandits, kidnappers, cattle rustlers as terrorists.</p><p>“So, with or without the gazette, what gives effect to such declaration is a judicial pronouncement but the gazette is a mere formality and it has been on and I believe within a matter of days, it will be concluded.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49tZqaZnJa6qnnRnq2emZyoeri02GaZmqaUnsG0ecCrnGaxlal6tbuMm5xmnJWYuaK%2BxJ1kmqtdqbKzvs6roKyso2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./648932-kogi-election-audu-replaced-biggest-rival-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kogi Election: APC To Replace Audu With Bello</span></a>
