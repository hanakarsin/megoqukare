The former Nirvana producer was prolific, and estimates suggest that he worked on several thousand albums during his career.</p><p>Steve's influence on rock music is hard to fully estimate, but even as some people wanted to learn more about his vast legacy, others were more interested in his personal life. Many wanted to know who Steve was married to. Here's what we know about his wife.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who was Steve Albini's wife?</h2><p>Steve was married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather Whinna</a>, who works as a filmmaker. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> has reported that the two first met in the 1990s, although exactly how they met is still unclear. Heather co-directed the 2004 film Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music? with Vickie Hunter, and she has also directed other short films throughout her career.</p><p>Heather currently lives in Chicago, which is also where Steve was doing his production work. The two of them spent plenty of time on charitable endeavors. An article for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost</a> called "Why I Haven't Had a Conventional Christmas in 20 Years" describes Heather and Steve's charitable endeavors. They frequently dedicated their Christmases to answering Santa letters and delivering gifts to those in need.</p><p>"Nineteen years ago, my wife Heather Whinna stopped by the post office on the way home," Steve wrote in his post. "She found bins there full of letters addressed to Santa Claus, left out by the post office for people to read and answer. Curious, she read a few of the letters and couldn't believe what she saw. These weren't impish requests for toys or a new bike; mostly, they were desperate pleas from heads of households asking for help."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Heather Whinna (@heatherinamasfina)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What was Steve Albini's cause of death?</h2><p>The news that Steve had died at just 61 left many who knew him or his work in shock, and naturally, some of them also wondered how he died.</p><p>The news of Steve's death was announced by staff at Electric Audio, which is where Steve worked. According to the announcement, Steve died of a heart attack.</p><p>Following that news, many paid tribute to Steve and the immense legacy he leaves behind.</p><p>"Meeting Steve Albini and working with him changed the course of my life," PJ Harvey wrote following his death. "He taught me so much about music, and life. Steve was a great friend — wise, kind, and generous. I am so grateful. My thoughts are with him and his family and friends as we suffer his loss."</p><p>"Really loving everyone celebrating Steve Albini," comedian Rob Delaney added. "I have been treating myself to High on Fire’s 'Blessed Black Wings,' an album he produced which changed the course of my music listening life and his scrapped early recordings of Fugazi’s 'In on the Kill Taker' on YouTube."</p><p>Steve's legacy is immense, and the tributes being paid to him are just a sliver of evidence supporting that fact.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmwsRmmKWamaO2bsPIn5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-sagay-speaks-on-plan-to-field-jonathan-buni-under-apc.html><span>←</span><span>Sagay Speaks On Plan To Field Jonathan, Buni Under APC</span></a>
