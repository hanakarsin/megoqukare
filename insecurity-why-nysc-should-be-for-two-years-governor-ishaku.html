You must allow them to protect themselves. Constitution or no constitution, you must first be alive.”</p><p>The governor also asked the federal government to train those residing in border communities on how to use guns so that they can protect themselves against banditry and kidnapping.</p><p>Ishaku said such communities should not be left alone for gunmen to attack them, if the government can’t protect them.</p><p>“I will still request the federal government that those who are at the border regions and those villages that are hard to reach, they must teach them how to use guns to protect themselves.</p><p>“You can’t leave human beings like that — at the whims and caprices of somebody who moves with an AK-47. This is wrong. They should train 10 or 20 people in each village along the axis of the boundaries,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49xZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmr5iueq%2FF0pxkrKCfqrmlecGeZJ%2BnomLBuLuMspyaqqNitLDCxKulqKpdnsCprcquZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-ricciardo-html.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel Ricciardo - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
