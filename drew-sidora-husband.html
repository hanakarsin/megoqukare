I always told myself that if I can play a role to fill the void of another child, I would and now I’m doing it! Shoutout to all the step dads that step up to be real dads and to uncles, cousins and friends that fill voids. It’s a challenging role, but understand your purpose and impact is greater than any acknowledgement you may or may not receive. To fathers that may not be as present due to whatever circumstance, understand it takes a village to raise a king/queen and please play your part. To all fathers all over the world, I salute you!! Make one of your goals in 2020 to be a better dad 💯. 📷@reubenchandlerphotography #dad #dadsmatter #dadgang</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Ralph Pittman</a> (@ralphpittmanjr) on Dec 31, 2019 at 1:37pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Shoutout to all the step dads that step up to be real dads and to uncles, cousins and friends that fill voids," Ralph continued.
