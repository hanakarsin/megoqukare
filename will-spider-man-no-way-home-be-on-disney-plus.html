Fans have been stoked to hear that there are plans to bring several Marvel movies and shows to Disney Plus, but will Spider-Man: No Way Home be one of them?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Disney execs say that no live-action ‘Spider-Man’ films will be on Disney Plus.</h2><p>There have been numerous announcements recently about some of Marvel and Disney Plus’s plans to bring content to the platform. So, it’s no wonder that some would assume this includes Spider-Man: No Way Home, especially since COVID-19 hindered its chances to hit actual theaters on its planned December 2020 release date. However, reports are saying that the chances of the film being on Disney Plus are slim to none.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>According to The Verge, Ricky Strauss, Disney’s head of content and marketing for Disney Plus, said at a recent media day that there aren’t any plans to bring the existing two Spider-Man live-action films to Disney Plus due to the rights of the film belonging to Sony. “That makes it infinitely more difficult for Disney to bring the movies over to its own streaming service,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a> reported.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“We love our friends at Sony, but we don’t have any plans to have the live-action Spider-Man movies on Disney Plus,” Ricky Strauss said. “We will have all the Spider-Man animated shows that we did so they’ll be on there under the Marvel banner. But who knows what can happen in the future?”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Netflix gained the rights to the ‘Spider-Man’ films.</h2><p>Since Sony owns the right to Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, they are the ones who ultimately get to decide where these films can be watched. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Business Insider</u><u> reports</u></a> that Sony and Netflix announced a five-year agreement that gives Netflix domestic streaming rights to Sony's theatrical releases beginning with its 2022 lineup. This means that Spider-Man: No Way Home will most likely find a home on Netflix after its theatrical release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Netflix will also have a first-look option for any movies Sony is making directly for streaming or planning to license for streaming, and Netflix has already committed to a number of those,” the outlet reported. “The deal includes future Sony Spider-Man movies and other titles that are part of Sony's universe of Marvel characters like Morbius, which hits theaters in January 2022 and stars Jared Leto as a vampire that is a frequent Spider-Man villain in the comics.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Twitter is sounding off about the fate of ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home.’</h2><p>When the news came out that, first, the new Spider-Man film had an official title: Spider-Man: No Way Home and second, that it would be “only in theaters,” Twitter sounded off. One fan wrote about the irony of Sony acting like Disney and said, “Spider-Man No Way Home literally having a tagline of 'only in movie theaters' is the most Disney thing Sony has done.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>wild that the only way to legally watch spiderman: no way home when it first comes out is in theaters because disney—owner of literally everything—can’t get the rights from sony to stream the mcu!spiderman movies on disney+ lmfao</p>— brie.
