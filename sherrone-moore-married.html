While Kelli prefers keeping her social media accounts private, she reps her husband in her bio, calling herself "Coach Moore's wife," a "Jesus lover," and an LGBTQIA+ ally.</p><p>Sherrone also shares glimpses of his marriage on his Instagram. He posted a touching tribute to Kelli on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">third wedding anniversary</a>.</p><p>"Happy three-year anniversary to my life partner and best friend," he wrote underneath photos of him and his wife. "So proud of you and all your accomplishments. I am so happy and blessed beyond measure to call you my wife as the man upstairs leads us to live through him.

In December 2019, they welcomed their first daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiloh Anne</a>. The coach's Instagram account shows many of Shiloh's early childhood moments, including watching her first Nationals game with her dad in 2020. However, Sherrone and Kelli have kept her off of his public account in recent years, likely due to her dad's fame.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sherrone Moore (@coachmooreum)</a></p></figure><p>Multiple outlets report show that Sherrone has another daughter, Solei, who was born in 2022.
