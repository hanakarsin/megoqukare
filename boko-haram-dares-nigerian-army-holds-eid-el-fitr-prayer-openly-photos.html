Lawan Andimi</a></strong>, the former Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in the Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State who was recently killed by the terrorists.</p><p>The prayers will hold from Friday, January 31, through to Sunday, February 2, 2020, and the pastors are expected to lead about 3,000-5000 other Christians in Kaduna State on the fasting and prayer mission.</p><p>The churches are expected to send representatives to the general prayer meeting as space may not contain everyone that may want to come. Others are encouraged to pray in their local assemblies.</p><p>The prayer and fasting is based on a National call by the <strong>Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)</strong>, <strong>Rev. Joseph Hayab</strong>, Chairman, Kaduna State chapter of CAN has confirmed.</p><p>Rev. Hayab also directed all Christians to wear “black clothes” on Sunday as a mark of mourning slain Christians.</p><p>“We are going to pray that those honest security men, God should help them and those (security men) that are dishonest, God should change their hearts.</p><p>“The national secretariat of CAN issued a circular, calling on all Christians to pray and fast on Friday, January 31, 2020 to February 2, 2020. The people will pray specifically against the evils happening in the country; the recent killing of Rev. Lawan Andimi and other Christians that have been killed by Boko Haram.</p><p>“The story we are hearing now is that Leah Sharibu has been forcefully converted into Islam or married and has given birth to children which to us, is not the matter. The matter is for her to be safe and return home. So, we want to pray so that God will intervene in the matter.</p><p>Lamenting that the situation seems to be beyond the powers of government officials and the security forces, the clergyman highlighted the importance of seeking spiritual intervention.</p><p>“We have reported this matter 100 times to security agents but we realised that we have to report this matter to the throne of heaven. This is because what men of power and security agents cannot do, God can do it.</p><p>“So, we are going to take it up with God in prayer on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The prayer will end in the afternoon in Zaria, Kafanchan and in Kaduna metropolis.</p><p>“We are calling on Christians that, as a mark of mourning, we should all appear in black clothes because we are mourning our beloved ones.</p><p>“We are mourning the calamity that has befallen us. We are mourning the lack of progress that we are experiencing in our country. We are mourning the bad things that are going on around us. We are asking God to hear our cries.</p><p>“It’s going to be a large gathering of not less than 1,000 pastors. In fact, we are expecting between 3,000 and 5,000 people to participate at the Kaduna State prayer and fasting. We have told them (churches) to send representatives because the venue will not contain us.</p><p>“We are saying God, do something; Leah Sharibu has suffered too much. Rev. Andimi has just been killed. That’s why we are going to call on God and say, ‘rise and do something,’” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5BuZpunm6R6qa3RmqRmnJGnsrR5zaKenqqZlrturdGmsGagn6GxtHnEoptmnZxis6rA0Wanq5mpmr9uu8%2BepaWxXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-my-life-true-story.html><span>←</span><span>'All My Life' Introduces Audiences to Jenn Carter and Solomon Chau's Extraordinary Love Story</span></a>
