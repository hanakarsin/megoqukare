The journey is not easy, there is a lot that is happening on the way. If you read the Bible, Job was put to temptation by God, all his relatives died but he remained strong.

Nobody can stop reggae," he said.<h2>Disregard of COVID-19 rules</h2><p class=align-left>However, many people raised concerns over how he broke COVID-19 rules after attracting a huge crowd of people who were maskless and who blatantly disregarded social distancing.</p><p class=align-left>Muli Kavolonza said:</p>"I thought public gatherings were banned!
