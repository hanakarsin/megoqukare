They include hearing impairment caused by seizure disorders, meningitis and high fever.</p>"Other reasons with speech delay include Autism Spectrum Disorder. Problems with the mouth. A speech delay can indicate an issue with the mouth, tongue, or palate," Dr Jandu explained.<p class=align-left>The medic noted that lack of stimulation can also cause speech delays.

Use everyday situations. To build on your child's speech and language, talk your way throughout the day. Talk to your baby and young child throughout the day, including during bath time, while changing diapers, and during meals. For example, get your child's attention, and then talk about what you're doing ("Look, I'm opening the refrigerator and I'm getting out food")," Dr Jandu explains.<p class=align-left>The paediatrician also encouraged the involvement of the speech and language therapist. This, he said, was important to help improve the speech as much as possible.</p>"Their expertise should be sought as we try to do our part at home and school," she adds.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
