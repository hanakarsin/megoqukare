One woman recently shared a rejection email she had gotten from a job on <a href=#>TikTok</a> and all we have to say is that the hiring manager/team behind that email woke up that morning and chose violence.</p><p>But it wasn't about what the letter said but the speed at which it was delivered. You see, after applying for this job, the woman was sent a rejection email so quickly that it could be seen as insulting.</p><p>So, what time did this woman apply and what time did she get rejected? We share the details below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Woman rejected for job 20 minutes after applying for position.</h2><p>A woman named Heather (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@heathermaekathryn)</a> recently shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a TikTok video</a> showing her followers two emails she had received that morning from the same company.</p><p>The first email she received was at 11 a.m. and it confirmed that her job application had been received.</p><p>Fast forward to 11:20 a.m. when she received the second email from the company, which explained that they would be moving forward with a different candidate.</p><p>"Can someone give the 22 year old a chance PLEASE" she wrote in her caption.</p><p>The comment section began to fill with comments, as many users had thoughts on this. As one person pointed out, "What a range of emotions in such a short time."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Another user opined that this might have happened due to the fact that sometimes companies are required to post a job listing online despite already having a candidate picked out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Other users sent their best wishes to Heather.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>And one person just tried to look at the bright side. "At least they responded. So many companies just never reply back," they wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>The point is that it's rough out there.</p><p>While this may have just been a funny coincidence as both emails appear to have been automated, it's always a struggle to find a job. It's also a struggle <a href=#>to lose a job</a>. And to work a job in a toxic environment or with <a href=#>an unreasonable boss</a>. Basically, jobs are never easy.</p><p>That said, TikTok is filled with stories about #worklife. And if you thought 20 minutes was a short amount of time, wait until you hear about this TikTok creator <a href=#>who quit only 10 minutes into a job</a>.</p><p>The things that can transpire in just a few minutes are wild.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mqZ6ilZjBprCMn6mopV2fvKN5kWlkpqGeqsGmv4yana2domKusbzLsqCnnw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-dropout-kate-mckinnon.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did Kate McKinnon Leave The Dropout?
