Saldana and Pratt are typing away at their phones; I mean, they each have an adoring public to keep happy on social media. Russell appears to simply enjoy a nap. Hey working in show business is tough work, long hours and sometimes very little time to get in a proper nap.</p><p>But take another look.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You can clearly see the generation gap<br>They phone it in<br>While he takes a nap</p>— Thomas Owens (@tprowens) <a href=#>October 12, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I thought Kurt Russell had a tiny personal hairdresser in this photo and tbh my brain was fine with the idea <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NjgNyawca0</a></p>— Jamie Ghost Fart (@jamiesmart) <a href=#>October 11, 2017</a></figure><p>Tiny. Hairdresser. Everything makes sense now.&nbsp;The confidence that Kurt gets from carrying around a miniature hairdresser to keep his thick locks looking perfect in every scene, no matter where he's shooting, is what gives him the edge over other actors. We knew something was off, cause you just don't get that sort of wonderful Kurt-Russel-hair without some sort of secret technique!&nbsp;</p><p>OK fine, it's definitely a depth perception thing that's going on with the photo, but that hasn't stopped me, and a bunch of other people online, from wanting this theory to be real.
