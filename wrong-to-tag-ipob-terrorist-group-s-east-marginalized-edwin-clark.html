In fact, the north-west has seven states, what injustice against a people.</p><p>“Look at the northernisation policy going on in the country. Appointments are skewed in favour of the north, in total disregard to the feelings of other areas. Key positions in the ministries, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, customs, police, you name it, are all given to northerners.</p><p>“There are 17 security arms, 14 of them are headed by northerners. Yet one expects that there shall be national unity. Of course, it will not be possible. There must be dissatisfaction and agitation.</p><p>“For instance, look at what is happening in the south-east today. Our critical national assets are being attacked almost every day. People are killed, maimed. While one is gravely against such a method of expressing grievance, the people are pushed to the wall.</p><p>“The south-east geopolitical zone could rightly be described as the most disadvantaged. One could not understand why the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) will be declared as a terrorist organization, while similar organizations in the north have not been so declared.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FvZrCqn6O0bsDOZquan12evbCujK2cq6qfp7a0wIygqaitoGLAbrHArKtmpZGntKq6wKWgs52UYrKlw8inZJykkae4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mart-n-cirio-html.html><span>←</span><span>Martn Cirio - Edad, Familia, Biografa</span></a>
