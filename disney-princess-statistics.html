But with 11 official princesses, there are enough of them to use statistics to reveal their true natures. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one out of 11 people are shoplifters</a>, which means at least one Disney princess has secretly lifted a lip gloss from Sephora. My bet's on Ariel as we all know she has a hoarding problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, more fun statistics involving your fave Disney princesses.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Statistically, at least two Disney princesses are considering plastic surgery.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>It's hard to believe given the fact that all the princesses are conventionally thin and attractive, but according to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RealSelf survey</a>, one in five women has considered cosmetic surgery, which means two out of the 11 Disney princesses must have thought about it, as well. Maybe Rapunzel is thinking of getting lip injections? Honestly, that thought is so disturbing, I'd rather just change the subject.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Three princesses are likely to never leave the house without makeup on.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2011 QVC survey</a>, one in three women refuses to leave the house makeup-less, which means three Disney princesses (whoever they are) are super vain about who sees them sans eyeliner. My hunch is on Elsa, Jasmine, and Cinderella. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Eight Disney princesses are in toxic friendships.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>Apparently, this is pretty common. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> conducted by TODAY and Self found that eight out of 10 women are friends with someone who's "toxic" or a bad influence. This is hilarious because most of the Disney princesses have no friends outside of talking animals. Princess Tiana is the only one who's best friends with a human female, but her pal is far from toxic — or so I thought.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. At least one Disney princess is likely to start her own business.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One in 10 women are starting businesses</a>, which means, statistically, there's at least one Disney princess with an entrepreneurial spirit. This is actually true, too. Princess Tiana so far is the only Disney princess with a job.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. One Disney princess would gladly give up sex for cake.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>One in six women would rather give up sex forever for a slice of chocolate cake, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a survey</a>. That means one Disney princess either has an insane sweet tooth or is having terrible sex. However, the survey was conducted by a cake company, so you should take all this with a grain of salt.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. One Disney princess would rather cuddle her cat than her partner.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 report</a> found that one in 10 women prefers their feline friends to their significant others, which is hardly surprising. The statistic seems pretty true to me. <a href=#>Princess Jasmine</a> seems to have more chemistry with Rajah than Aladdin.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. At least three Disney princesses have a problem with "drunk shopping."</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Finder.com survey</a>, one in three people is spending billions of dollars on drunken purchases, which means the Disney princesses must be, too. The average drunk shopper spends up to $200 on clothes, gambling, and other impulsive purchases.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Two of the married Disney princesses are sleeping in separate beds from their husbands.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>Out of the 11 princesses, eight of them are married. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">survey from the National Sleep Foundation</a>, one in four couples sleeps in separate beds, which means at least two princesses are having marriage problems. Although that's hardly surprising considering most Disney couples hook up and get married without even knowing each other.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. At least six Disney princesses are likely to call themselves feminists.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 Washington Post survey</a> found that six in 10 women are proud to call themselves a feminist, a number that's probably increased even higher today. So that means, statistically, most of the Disney princesses consider themselves feminists, which is pretty awesome when you think about it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Two Disney princesses are snooping in their partner's phone.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>Although smartphones don't exist in the Disney princess world, if they did, at least two jealous princesses would be obsessively peeking at their significant other's device. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 survey</a> found that one in four women does this — or at least is bold enough to admit it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Two Disney princesses are more turned on by shoes than their partners.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>This statistic is true for at least one in five women, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">survey by ShoeBuy</a>. Obviously, one of them has to be Cinderella, but if her prince is as into feet as he appears to be in the movie, he probably doesn't mind.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. At least one Disney princess is in a relationship with someone who's not the "love of her life."</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Walt Disney Studios</span></figure><p>Apparently, there are a lot of princesses in crappy relationships. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 survey</a>, 73 percent of women, or one in seven, are in "make do" relationships. Considering how many princesses got married to complete strangers, I'm hardly surprised. I guess Disney princesses are more like us than we thought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpcV9mgXCmo4Gupn5fmba0usSyZKmqmaOwpr%2FSZqqtmaSewLW1wqw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luxury-first-class-suites.html><span>←</span><span>These Luxury First Class Suites Will Make You Hate Flying Coach Even More</span></a>
