Yesterday was a very sad day as I witnessed a gory-looking fatal accident along the Ibadan/Lagos expressway. I was in tears while I watched many fight for their lives in pain. 6 died, and others were hospitalized. Thanks to FRSC along that axis that showed as early as they could after my life video. The driver of the bus was drunk. DO NOT DRINK TOO MUCH AND STILL DRIVE.</p><p>“The passengers were said to be cautioning the bus driver’s reckless driving but he was been defensive that he knew what he was doing. Now many are gone. MAY THE SOULS OF THE DEPARTED REST IN PEACE. While we pray that God heals others with brutal injuries.</p><p>“Thanks to everyone who showed concern and helped yesterday from the FRSC guys, citizens, and the doctors. Feb 11th wasn’t a good day on Ibadan through the Lagos expressway. There were also 2 other accidents in front, making 3 different accident spots on the same day.</p><p>“May accident not be our portion. Let’s always remember to thank God for going out and returning home safe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BtZqyhqGKxpq3DZqatoJWnwG60zqynoqyRoba7scNmpaiknK7EsLvDZpicrJ%2BnerOxwqisp6yjYsGzrcaimmaZk5i2pbHNrWSarF2er6KwwKdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-if-you-tell-siri-112.html><span>←</span><span>What Happens if You Tell Siri 112?
