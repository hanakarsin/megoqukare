So amid their television reality filming, the family members typically try to find some stability in their jobs, including<a href=#> Micah Plath</a>.</p><p style=text-align:left>TV personality Micah is the son of Kim and Barry Plath. Born in 2001, he is one of 11 kids in the family. All grown up now, he has a full and separate life. Let's take a look at what Micah gets up to off the television skin.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: INSTAGRAM/@micahplath</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What Is Micah Plath's job?</h2><p>Micah is from the small town of Cairo, Ga., but in order to make a massive career change, he needed to take a leap of faith. The star ditched his Southern town and moved to Los Angeles to pursue modeling.</p><p>He announced the move on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, writing, "As many of you know I’ve made a big move out to Los Angeles, what an adventure it’s been so far! From adjusting to gas prices to making friends out here, looking at life with a different perspective, and realizing how small my hometown was haha. But I really miss these special people! Let @ethan.plath @moriah.jasper and @oliviamarieplath I want them to come out to L.A. soon."</p><p>According to his Instagram bio, he is signed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Select Model,</a> who manages his bookings. Their site advertises: "Its original ethos — getting on the streets and ‘scouting’ natural, individual, and unique looks and talent to be nurtured into major names — is as important today as it was four decades ago and will go on to be the foundation of the new, global Select."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: INSTAGRAM/@micahplath</span></figure><p>In January 2024, he unveiled a cover of "Beach Boys" where he was center stage. YummyZine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a>, "Today we unveil something very exciting! Introducing @micahplath on the cover of “BEACH BOYS” — a new and incredible book by photographer @sashaxolsen that he has been working on for over two years."</p><p>"Shifting gears to get on your level," he wrote in 2022 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> his cover story on Trending Male Model Magazine. The star posed shirtless in a black-and-white snap.</p><p>However, the bi-coastal star decided to move to Florida while still pursuing his modeling career. This allowed him to be more involved in the television show again.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, the choice was made because he wanted to follow "a beautiful girl," but it didn't come without some hesitancy. After all, it was a major move to make.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: INSTAGRAM/@micahplath</span></figure><p>It's unclear if Micah plans to have a job outside of modeling, but his mother did weigh in on her vision for him in the future. "I don't see him ever having a desk job," Kim said on the series premiere. "He loves physical labor."</p><p>According to his Instagram, this seems to ring true as he's a very physical person. Micah spends a good bit of time at the gym and lifting weights. "Lift laugh love is my new slogan," he wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a>.</p><p>Outside of his working career, he also love spending time outdoors, including canoeing and fishing. Micah has also been spending a considerable amount of time with his Plath family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforakrcdmp6WZpJ16q7vB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./davido-excited-as-he-links-up-with-model-kendall-jenner.html><span>←</span><span>Davido Excited As He Links Up With Model, Kendall Jenner</span></a>
