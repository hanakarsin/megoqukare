Well, in what felt like a similar moment, actress Jennifer Aniston was seemingly doused in fake oil while surrounded by protestors in the Big Apple recently."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

There even appeared to be riot police involved. She was wearing a sleeveless white top (no fur detected), which was soon covered in a black oil-like substance thanks to some aggressive protestors. Jen looked absolutely horrified.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Don't worry ... Jennifer's oil moment was just a scene for 'The Morning Show.'</h2><p>Lest you worry that Jen did anything to deserve getting soaked in oil, she was actually just filming a scene for the upcoming fourth season of <a href=#>Apple TV Plus</a>'s <a href=#>The Morning Show</a>. Jen was in character as Alex Levy, a complicated main character in the drama series.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This isn't the first time a celeb has had something poured on them.</h2><p>Remember when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">someone threw sugar</a> at <a href=#>Adam Levine</a> outside of the Jimmy Kimmel Live studios in 2015? Probably because Adam has a song called "Sugar" with his band <a href=#>Maroon 5</a>. Hah, so clever! (Not.) Actually, the same dude who sugar-bombed Adam also once threw a rock at <a href=#>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>, so ... I guess that's his thing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Adam Levine gets "sugar-bombed" in 2015</p></figure><p>If you go back even further to 2005, someone thought it would be funny to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">squirt water in Tom Cruise</a>'s face while interviewing him at the premiere of his film War of the Worlds. The guy was posing as a reporter, and I guess he was hoping the prank wouldn't land him in hot water (sorry, bad pun), but no one was laughing.</p><p>Sometimes things get taken too far, like in the case of a fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">throwing his phone</a> at singer <a href=#>Bebe Rexha</a> while she was up on stage during a concert in NYC in 2023. Bebe had to go to the hospital afterward, and she posted a pic of herself where you can see bandages around her badly bruised eye. Maybe let's not do stuff like this, folks!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ailaO7qrLEq2SappmowbC6jKCcrWWfnrluwMerprCmXaS7brTEqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./osun-2022-oyetola-to-know-fate-in-disqualification-suit-on-thursday.html><span>←</span><span>Oyetola To Know Fate In Disqualification Suit On Thursday</span></a>
