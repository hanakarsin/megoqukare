Instead, the company has been replaying their most dramatic and memorable past seasons. We've gotten to watch love build and breakups happen all over again, and it reminded us that <a href=#><strong>Ali Fedotowsky's job</strong></a> almost kept her from the spotlight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">According to Ali Fedotowsky, a job was the reason she left the show.</h2><p>Ali Fedotowsky entered into the world of reality TV when she was cast as a potential love interest in Season 6 of The Bachelor. On the season, titled The Bachelor: On the Wings of Love, she vied for the attention of pilot Jake Pavelka. The season first aired on Jan. 4, 2010 and along with 24 other women, she went looking for love on a television show.&nbsp;</p><p>During an episode of The Bachelor, Ali confronted Jake and told him that she needed to leave the show. It wasn't that she didn't feel a connection with him or that anything bad had happened between the women. It was Ali Fedotowsky's job that gave her an ultimatum: leave the show and come back to work, or you're fired.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"I don't know if I made the right choice! It's so hard," Ali sobbed in the limo as she drove away during the episode where she quit to go back to work. &nbsp;</p><p>"What did I do? How could I have left him?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a> while heading back to San Francisco, Calif. where she worked as a sales representative for Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>"It hurts like crazy that Ali is gone, I didn't expect to come all of this way to get my heart broken again," Jake said at the time, after Ali had left. "I'm trying to find my inner strength, because the easiest thing in the world would be to just give up right now but I don't think it's in my cards to be devastated and single at the end of this process."&nbsp;</p><p>While that's the reason Ali gave for leaving the show early, Facebook said in a statement that they didn't force her to. "We appreciate the personal decision to return to work was deeply difficult, but we're glad Ali decided to come back," the spokesperson said, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Monday we're going all in üò± Get ready to relive Ali's season on #TheBachelorGOAT!</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Bachelor</a> (@bachelorabc) on Aug 1, 2020 at 10:00am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">That wasn't the last time fans got to see Ali though ‚Äì later coming back as the lead for 'The Bachelorette' Season 6.</h2><p>During the show, she found love with contestant Roberto Martinez, getting engaged during the finale.
