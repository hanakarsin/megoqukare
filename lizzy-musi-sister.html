Because of the treacherous nature of the franchise, along with its beloved racers, it has amassed a large and dedicated fanbase. One of the most popular stars of Street Outlaws was <a href=#>Lizzy Musi</a>, daughter of legendary racing personality and engine builder Pat Musi.</p><p>Following the news of Street Outlaws star <a href=#>Lizzy Musi's tragic death</a>, fans have been wanting to learn more about her family. In fact, Lizzy had two sisters, Rose Marie "Bobo" and Patricia "Tricia" Musi, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her obituary</a>. While little is known about Bobo (she doesn't appear to be active on social media), we do know Tricia is a known racer. Here's everything to know about Lizzy's siblings.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook/@tricia musi</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lizzy Musi's sister, Tricia Musi, is also a professional racer.</h2><p>Lizzy Musi wasn't the only one to follow in her father's footsteps — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lizzy's sister Tricia</a> is also a successful racer. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her website</a>, Tricia has been racing for 23 years and is even a 2019 NMCA Nitrous Pro Street World Champion. In a profile by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drag Illustrated</a> in 2020, Tricia was named one of their prominent "2019 30 Under 30" figures in the race world.</p><p>"I love drag racing and I love everything about it. It’s the only thing I know,” Tricia told the publication. “I try to push myself really, really hard. It feels great. To win the championship this year in my dad’s old car that he won championships in, it’s seriously a dream come true. I just want to keep going up."</p><p>As of the time of writing, Tricia has not publicly acknowledged the announcement of her sister's death. Her most recent social media posts are from September 2017.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lizzy Musi (@lizzymusi)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Lizzy Musi have any kids?</h2><p>Because Lizzy comes from a line of racing royalty, another major question surrounding Lizzy's death is whether or not the young star had any children of her own.</p><p>Based on what it known to the public, Lizzy did not have any children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoba7xthmpK6rmWLAqr%2FTnqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chasing-the-cure-doctors.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Real-Life Medical Experts</span></a>
