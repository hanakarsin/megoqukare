Fr. Ejike Mbaka has been removed from heading the Adoration Ministry Enugu, Naija News reports.</h2><p>The Church, however, lifted the ban and allowed Mbaka to resume service on October 2.</p><p>In the latest development, <strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Fr Mbaka has now been transferred out of the Adoration Ministry and sent to Monastery.</p><p>The Church’s action has since generated a barrage of reactions from Fr Mbaka’s followers.</p><p>The church has reportedly replaced Fr. Mbaka at the Adoration Ministry with another clergy of the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, Rev. Fr. <strong>Anthony Amadi.</strong></p><p>A top member of the ministry who confirmed the posting to the Daily Post described the development as unfortunate.</p><p>According to him, “all along, the Bishop has been trying to take over the Adoration Ministry. But I can assure you that no priest will succeed there. So long as Fr. Mbaka is not there, nobody will come there to worship.</p><p>“This will lead to anarchy. It’s unthinkable that this kind of harsh decision could be made. We the adorers will never accept any other priest.</p><p>“Fr. Mbaka suffered and built that place will sole effort. Now they have tactically hijacked the place through the backyard. Let’s see how they will succeed.”</p><p>The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christain Church of God (RCCG), Pastor<strong> Enoch Adeboye</strong>, on Sunday prayed for Nigeria as the country marked its 62nd Independence.</p><p>Delivering a sermon at the national headquarters of the church, the renowned clergy said the country is at war, hence Nigerians should not deceive themselves.</p><p>Adeboye who spoke on the topic ‘PEACE IN THE LAND’, asked the congregation, Christians all over the country to pray for Nigerian leaders, those in public offices and traditional rulers.</p><p>Speaking on the challenges faced in Nigeria, Adeboye noted that as many times the country’s power generating set (The National Grid) has collapsed, there was always light in the Aso Rock Villa.</p><p>The gospel preacher went on to lament the growing insecurity in Nigeria, recalling how a state governor narrowly escape assassination by bandit terrorists.</p><p>“If we are talking about security, governors should have it. But someone who is surrounded by security guards could not go to his farm freely”, Adeboye noted.</p><p>“Recently, I asked for the cost of a flight ticket from Lagos to Abuja and I was told it’s around N280,000.</p><p>“I shouted because I remember it was about N67,000 some time ago. However, I was informed why the price went up“, Adeboye said.</p><p>Pastor Adeboye at the end of his sermon, prayed for perfect peace in Lagos, Nigeria at large.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49sZqOto6l6qrqMnJitoJ%2BhtqR50Z6kqK6VqHqnvoymmZqjkWKzs7vMZpidp6KWwaq7zWakoqaZqMGzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-refuse-a-grammy.html><span>←</span><span>Can You Refuse a Grammy Award?
