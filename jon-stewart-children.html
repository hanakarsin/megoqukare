The couple decided to use in vitro fertilization to conceive, which is how they were able to have two children.

In fact, he made <a href=#>his Twitter account</a> in January of 2021. But considering that he's not big into social media, he may not post photos of his kids in order to protect their privacy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jon Stewart has been with his wife for over 20 years.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, Jon and Tracey McShane met back in the 1990s on a blind date.
