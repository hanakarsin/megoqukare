Naija News reported that this development is coming about two weeks after President Bola Tinubu declared the end of the fuel subsidy regime during his inauguration.
This platform understands that the increase would eventually lead to the end of all forms of energy subsidy in the country.
According to The Guardian, with a monthly subsidy of about N50 billion still in the electricity sector owing to revenue shortfall, the tariff hike due from July 1, may be another acid test for the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration’s market reform."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

If the electricity tariff goes up as envisaged, the question remains if there will be value for the quantum of electricity so paid for.</p><p>“The truth remains that if electricity supply is constant, of the right quantity and quality, the envisaged upward review in the tariff will be gladly absorbed by the populace.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5ByZqehl5q%2Fqq3NrGStp12lrrp5zKipnmWWpL9uscuemq2qmZi2tcWMrKuaqqSeu6h5xaumpmWaqrm6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-html.html><span>←</span><span>Famous Wills | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
