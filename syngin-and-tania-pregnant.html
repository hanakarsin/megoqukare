Here’s what we know about the duo’s engagement going into 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Syngin and Tania pregnant with baby No. 1?</h2><p>Neither reality star has spoken out about a breakup or a baby, but a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soap Dirt</a> that Tania is expecting. In a screenshot of an Instagram story obtained by the publication, the anonymous insider says, "So I have a friend of a friend that knows Tania and she says her and the guy aren’t together and she’s pregnant now."</p><p>Syngin has made it abundantly clear that he’s not ready to start a family, which became a point of contention in his relationship with Tania. "For me, I’m still kind of figuring out what I actually want to do with my life," he said when she asked about his timeline on an early episode.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>In a confessional, Syngin added that he won’t let Tania’s strong opinions on the matter sway him. "Something as big as having a child is something that I’m not gonna buckle [on]," he shared. "I will not, like, be under [pressure] and told when to have a child."</p><p>The 29-year-old reiterated that kids are a long way off when asked about the subject <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a> in November. "Well right now I don’t want a [child], but in the far future I would be happy with one, but it’s something I am yet to desire on," he wrote in his stories.</p><p>Shortly after reports of their alleged split surfaced, Tania posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a photo of the duo</a> on Instagram, though it had clearly been taken a while ago based on Syngin’s haircut. She hasn’t shared an image or video of them together for over a month.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been even longer since Syngin has written about the pair. His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last picture with Tania</a> was published on Oct. 31 and highlighted the moment the South African bartender told the camera, "I don’t think it’s realistic right now to have a child." Things don't look promising for these two.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tania’s trip to Costa Rica may have been the final nail in the coffin.</h2><p>Viewers cringed when Tania revealed that she was leaving Syngin in America for a month-long herbalism program in Central America.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s a great opportunity for me to go and learn from indigenous and Afro-Caribbean people about natural medicine and natural remedies," the 29-year-old said at the time, adding that she sees the course as an investment for her and Syngin’s future. "We’d love to make our own products, start a small business."</p><p>Syngin was less than thrilled to be spending a third of his stay in the U.S. with just his future mother-in-law for company. "Tania leaving for 30 days in the middle of the 90 days is not at all something I really wanted, especially [since] our time limit is already so short," he admitted.</p><p>We’ll no doubt get the full story on the upcoming reunion show. Watch new episodes of 90 Day Fiancé Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMavs8inZJqmlGLBorrImmSpqpWcu6K60w%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diamond-jackson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Diamond Jackson - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
