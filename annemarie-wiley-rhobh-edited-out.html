However, well into the season, fans started to notice that Annemarie was shown less and less, which led some to wonder if Annemarie was actually edited out of RHOBH episodes. That seems almost too ridiculous to be true though, right?</p><p>This is Bravo reality TV we're talking about. If one storyline supersedes another, then it gets more attention in any given season, let alone episode. And that may be the case for Annemarie arriving at a time when other stories might be a tad more salacious or interesting for producers. Still, as a newbie here as part of the main cast, you'd think you would see more of her in Season 13.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Was Annemarie Wiley edited out of 'RHOBH' episodes?</h2><p>Although Annemarie is introduced in Season 13 as a new cast member, she isn't actually shown to viewers until Episode 6. However, after that, Annemarie appears less and less, and there's no real mention of why that is, or any acknowledgement of this on the show. RHOBH producers haven't come forward to admit to purposely editing Annemarie out of specific episodes or storylines either.</p><p>But it's possible that her scenes just didn't land when it came time to edit the Season 13 episodes. And it does make sense why some fans might believe that Annemarie was edited out. As one fan pointed out on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, when Annemarie is brought in during Season 13, much of her dialogue revolves around Sutton Stracke's "esophagus disorder."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Someone else commented on the thread with: "She's truly awful. This episode solidified that." And another wrote, "I hope she doesn't attend the reunion." In a way, Annemarie's inadvertent absence during Season 13 RHOBH is a self-fulfilling prophecy, since it's apparently making fans less inclined to want to see her.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Annemarie a full-time cast member or a "friend of" on 'RHOBH'?</h2><p>Ahead of RHOBH Season 13, Annemarie was announced as a main cast member. But, since viewers haven't seen much of her on the show and given the fact that she doesn't have much of a storyline of her own, it seems like she is more like a "friend of a housewife." And if things keep going this way, she may return in Season 14 as just that.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>One thing that could ramp up Annemarie's storyline on RHOBH is what appears to be an ongoing feud with fellow housewife Crystal Kung-Minkoff. Annemarie accused Crystal of saying that Sutton Stracke has an eating disorder. Crystal then retaliated by saying that Annemarie is "such a b-tch." So there is some hope that Annemarie can be a more central, pot stirring, housewife.</p><p>Watch The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruvscyaqaKdXay2rbHYZqmhp5KdeqawyK2cnWWfqsE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-island-usa-lawsuit.html><span>←</span><span>Trouble in Paradise: Former 'Love Island USA' Employees Filed a Lawsuit Against Production</span></a>
