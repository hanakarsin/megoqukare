The upward trend in inflation following the post-pandemic period was exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, soaring to record highs in many countries”, the report claimed.</p><p>“The escalation of the war has fueled a rise in commodity prices, particularly food and energy prices. High pass-through of food and fuel prices to consumer prices has caused headline inflation to spike.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_20221226-064025.png alt="World Bank Laments That Extreme Poverty Is Increasing In Nigeria" width=720 height=470 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The World Bank also claimed that the economic activity in Nigeria is being hampered by rising inflation and that the war in Ukraine has made the inflationary trend that followed the post-pandemic period worse.</p><p>“The escalation of the war has fueled a rise in commodity prices, particularly food and energy prices. High pass-through of food and fuel prices to consumer prices has caused headline inflation to spike”, the report added.</p><p>“The fiscal space to mount effective responses today is gone because of high levels of debt across Sub-Saharan African countries, rising borrowing costs, and depleted public savings.”</p><p>In a recent analysis of Nigeria’s poverty map, the National Bureau of Statistics determined that 62.9% of Nigerians, or almost 133 million people, are multidimensionally poor. Compared to the World Bank’s earlier projection, which put 95 million Nigerians below the poverty line, the current estimate marks a huge increase.</p><p>“A Better Future for All Nigerians: Nigeria Poverty Assessment 2022” is another World Bank research that underlined the urgent need for substantial structural changes supported by data to bring millions of Nigerians out of poverty.</p><p>According to the report, Nigeria’s efforts to reduce poverty are being hampered by slow growth, insufficient human capital, flaws in the labor market, and exposure to shocks.</p><p>As many as four out of every ten Nigerians live below the poverty line, according to the research, which compiles the most recent data on the profile and causes of poverty in Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FvZrCnoqGxbq7Ap6JmpJGisq%2FA0maroZmkYrK5wNGepJ5loKTDpr7TsmSiq12eu6S%2BxJqqoqaXYravec2inp6qmZZ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./covid-19-tinubu-tables-fresh-request-before-buhari.html><span>←</span><span>Tinubu Tables Fresh Request Before Buhari</span></a>
