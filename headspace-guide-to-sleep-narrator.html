Though screen time often makes it challenging to wind down at the end of a busy day, both companies recognize that it's unrealistic to expect that everyone can unplug.&nbsp;</p><p>Headspace teamed up with the streaming service for three programs that are geared toward helping subscribers in their daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Headspace Guide to Sleep is the second series to be released through this partnership, and it consists of seven episodes (which are all less than 20 minutes long).</p><p>With eye-catching animation and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">soothing narrator</a> to offer sleep tips, Headspace Guide to Sleep might become a go-to view when bedtime approaches.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Evelyn Lewis Prieto is the 'Headspace Guide to Sleep' narrator.</h2><p>Though Headspace co-founder Andy Puddicombe lended his voice to the first program in the partnership, Headspace Guide to Meditation, there's a different narrator for the sleep series.&nbsp;</p><p>Evelyn Lewis Prieto's calming English accent is walking viewers through all seven episodes of the limited series.</p><p>Those who are familiar with Headspace will likely recognize Evelyn's voice. She's a Director of Meditation a Mindfulness teacher at the company. She often leads events, Q&As, and exercises online.&nbsp;</p><p>Evelyn has been working at Headspace for more than seven years, and she embarked on her meditation journey when she was stressed at her previous advertising job. A friend encouraged her to download the Headspace app, and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p>When she first began working at Headspace, Evelyn was based in London. In 2017, she made the move to Los Angeles as Headspace further expanded.&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, she's taken on a co-hosting role on the Radio Headspace podcast while Andy Puddicombe takes a break.</p><p>When Headspace Guide to Sleep debuted on the streaming service, Evelyn took to Instagram to share her thoughts on the series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Beyond excited and grateful to have played a role in getting this out into the world alongside our incredible partners @Netflix @VoxMedia," she wrote.

The show has not been renewed for another season, and it doesn't look like there are any concrete plans for it to continue.</p><p>Because the Headspace and Netflix partnership is for three shows, viewers can expect to see another calming program in the future.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The concept of the third and final show has not yet been publicly revealed, though the companies did tease that it will be "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive</a>."
