After dedicating endless time and energy to one’s role, being fired often feels like a slap in the face … especially when it’s impersonal.

When the creator asked her co-workers if they had also received meeting invites and they said no, she had a hunch about where the call would lead.</p><p>However, when Annie texted her boss and shared her concern that she would be laid off, he told her not to worry because she had just begun working with a new customer.</p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn't the case when the creator arrived at her one-on-one meeting the next morning and came face to face with the company’s CEO. “I just sat back, disassociated, and let them lay me off,” Annie recalled in her video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@anniesanalytics href=#>@anniesanalytics</a><p>Storytime of what it was like for me to get laid off! 😬 I had an interview lined up later that day so I wasn't heartbroken. It was just strange to experience a layoff like that.

Annie admitted that she understood the reasoning and had recently grown suspicious about her future with the company.</p><p>As if being laid off wasn’t bad enough, Annie suffered the demoralizing experience of watching her Slack channels, Microsoft Outlook, and Dropbox cut off while attending her firing via video call.</p><p>“It was very depersonalizing to realize that, in an instant, the customer relationships that I had built [and] other coworkers relationships that I had built, were just gone,” the creator shared. “And all of these projects I was working on and was right in the middle of … just poof, see ya!”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The woman urged others to take employment with a grain of salt.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@anniesanalytics</span></figure><p>After the incredibly impersonal experience that was Annie’s firing, she vowed to no longer go above and beyond for anyone other than herself in the corporate world. “At the end of the day, my employment was no more than a business decision,” the creator argued.</p><p>Annie noted that her former company would constantly boast about caring deeply for its employees and won one of the “Best Places to Work” in 2022; however, corporate loyalty to employees only goes so far.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@anniesanalytics href=#>@anniesanalytics</a><p>Here's how I'm doing post-layoff as I launch into my second job search in data.
