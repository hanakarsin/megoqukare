And this is why the UTM Offshore project will involve the development and financing of a 1.52 million tonnes per annum FLNG facility with a capacity to process 176 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day and condensate,” Sylva stated.</p><p>He added, “I am aware that the UTM FLNG unit will also target the processing of associated gas currently flared in order to cut carbon emissions and monetise additional reserves for the domestic and global markets, which aligns with the Federal Government’s gas flare commercialisation program and the decade of gas agenda.”</p><p>The minister praised the African Export-Import Bank for making the signing of the MoU to raise the required funds for the project possible, maintaining that this will lead to more deals in the gas sector.</p><p>Sylva said, “Let me use this opportunity to thank Afreximbank, under the leadership of its amiable President and Chairman, Dr. Benedict Okey Oramah, for orchestrating the signing of the MoU with UTM Offshore Limited to raise $5bn for the development of Nigeria’s first Floating Liquefied Natural Gas project.</p><p>“While I believe the MoU will pave the way for additional collaboration between both entities to support a final investment decision on the project, I look forward to more MoUs between Afreximbank and other entities to launch other firsts like the first Floating Methanol Production plant, first Floating Blue Ammonia Production plant, and other technologies with a view to creating a zero-carbon emission fuel in Nigeria.”</p><p>The minister pointed out that the number of offshore gas finds had surged in recent years around the world, with LNG and floating LNG becoming even more important in terms of satisfying the world’s future energy needs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BxZq2gopqybrXNrZyrppGptrC6wKVkqKGcYq6vsIygmKxlk6S6sa3NopysZaOetK95lJulZpufo8GzrcKtZLChpJ16r7XGnqmimV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-they-are-planning-terrible-things-charly-boy-alert-nigerian-youths-of-agenda-from-enemies.html><span>←</span><span>They Are Planning Terrible Things Charly Boy Alert Nigerian Youths Of Agenda From Enemies</span></a>
