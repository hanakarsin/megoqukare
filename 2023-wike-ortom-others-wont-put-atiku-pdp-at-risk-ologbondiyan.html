I know he will not do a thing like that and I am very confident about that.</p><p>“I know it as a fact that Governors Samuel Ortom is contesting for Senate in Benue and the senate and presidential elections come up on the same day and same time.</p><p>“I know Governor Ikpeazu has senatorial interest too. So you think that they would sit down as politicians and seed out that out to a party that they don’t have conviction about its performance? That is not the way politicians do their thing and I am sure of that.</p><p>“He (Wike) is at liberty to associate with them. It is until Governor Wike picks APC or other political parties’ membership cards then we can conclude he has left the party. Until then, he remains a member of PDP.</p><p>“For us in the party, what is important is how we will win the 2023 election. What is important to us as a party is how we will relieve Nigerians from the burden of APC and President Muhammadu Buhari.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BwZmtoYmh6uLXKnmSoqqSkum6706Gcq6tdrLyvwIyprK1lkam2rMGMqZupZZGperO10qRkqKSfnK%2BwusOisJqmXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-cynthia-bailey-and-peter-thomas-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did Cynthia Bailey and Peter Thomas Divorce?
