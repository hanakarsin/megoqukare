Here's what to know.</h2><p>Moonshiners is filmed in the heart of Appalachia and features moonshiners in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.</p><p>Obviously the show can't get too deep into the specifics of where the moonshiners are conducting their business, as the activities are meant to be done discreetly.</p><p>The Appalachian region's history with moonshine makes sense, then, considering the isolation it offers. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AppalachianTrailHistory.com</a> notes, "[h]omemade liquor is frequently called 'moonshine' because it was commonly made at night, under the cover of darkness and by the light of the moon. This subterfuge helped to keep this illegal activity under wraps and away from the notice of law enforcement."</p><p>The site also mentions that there are many Appalachian residents with Scots-Irish ancestry, whose ancestors brought traditional homebrewed whiskeys with them to the new region, utilizing the isolation of the Appalachian area to do so.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Discovery Channel</span></figure><p>The business has been legalized in some states — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including North Carolina and South Carolina</a>, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a> — with the operation of legal microdistilleries.</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheSmokies.com</a> notes, the illegal aspect of the moonshine-making business pretty much comes down to unpaid taxes, which is why "so many moonshine distilleries openly make and sell moonshine.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, cast members have dealt with real threats from law enforcement off-camera in the past. <a href=#>Tim Smith</a> opened up about a time when police officers confronted him about his connection with the show. The cops apparently handed him screenshots from the show to full-on accuse him of illegally producing moonshine –– but he maintained his cool the entire time.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Naturally, there’s been a ton of conversation revolving around whether or not Moonshiners is a legitimate reality TV show.
