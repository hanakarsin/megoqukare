The statement did clarify that executives Ron Rice and Tyler Dennis will lead the day-to-day operations at PGA while Jay is out.</p><p>Jay doesn't have any publicly known medical conditions, so there's very little context to draw from in terms of what the issues he's experiencing now might be, or how long it may take him to recover from them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING NEWS: The PGA Tour has released a statement saying commissioner Jay Monahan is "recuperating from a medical situation" and that Ron Price, chief operating officer, and Tyler Dennis, executive VP and president, will lead day-to-day operations of the Tour.</p>— Golf Central (@GolfCentral) <a href=#>June 14, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The PGA is in the midst of a massive controversy.</h2><p>Jay's decision to go out on leave comes just days after the PGA announced that they would merge with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Tour. The new entity will be backed by money from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, and the announcement came with its own wave of controversy. The Saudi's deep pockets are undoubtedly an attractive prospect for any business, but it's also true that the Saudis have an abysmal human rights record.</p><p>In fact, the Saudi's investment in sports, and in golf in particular, are part of a broader effort known as sports-washing, a tactic employed by problematic governments in an attempt to distract from the way they treat their citizens. By emphasizing their investment in sports, and by proxy the attractiveness of the country as a tourist destination, they ensure that those abroad know the country for something other than its human rights record.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joint Statement from Ron Price, Chief Operating Officer, and Tyler Dennis, Executive Vice President & President, PGA TOUR <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/W0OGH1r4ag</a></p>— PGA TOUR Communications (@PGATOURComms) <a href=#>June 14, 2023</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@PGATOURComms</span></figure><p>That's the reason that, when the PGA LIV deal was first announced, many in the sports world were appalled by the news. Jay was one of the focal points of that criticism, which comes after months of litigation and negotiation between the two organizations.</p><p>Following the news, Sen. Richard Blumenthal said that he plans to launch an investigation into the deal, and there is some skepticism about whether the merger will ultimately be a success. For now, though, Jay is stepping back from orchestrating that deal, and focusing instead on his own health.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn666ecyopZqgkaN6qbHApauhZaWlsaLAxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-lexi-get-fired-from-below-deck-med.html><span>←</span><span>Captain Sandy Made a &amp;quot;Hard Decision&amp;quot; About Lexi Wilson's Future on 'Below Deck Mediterranean'</span></a>
