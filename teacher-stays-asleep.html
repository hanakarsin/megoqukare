Although it's funny, I mean, really funny to watch unsuspecting sleepyheads get their comeuppances, there are some professors who actually let some of their students get in a quick nap while they're lecturing, believe it or not."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I let her. I didn't take it personally. She has zero-hour math, farm-girl chores, state-qualifying 4X400 fatigue, adolescent angst, and various other things to deal with.

She didn't get her essay turned in. She knew that. I knew that, but I didn't beat her up about it. Didn't have to. She emailed it to me last night at 9:00 PM. On her own.

I get it, and I'm not suggesting that we make it a permanent part of repertoire /routine, but I am suggesting that we sometimes trust our instincts, even if it goes against the grain, maybe especially</p>— Monte Syrie (@MonteSyrie) <a href=#>May 16, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>if it goes against the grain, for I am not always convinced the grain best considers kids. In a different room, Meg may have been written up for sleeping in class and given a zero for a missing essay, but she wasn't in a different room; she was in my room. My room.</p>— Monte Syrie (@MonteSyrie) <a href=#>May 16, 2018</a></figure><p>Call it being overly sympathetic, or call it maybe not being harsh enough, but Syrie considered the student in question, taking her situation into account, and decided to treat her accordingly.</p><p>Syrie knows that this particular student, Meg, has a butt-load of farm work to handle at home. That she's an athlete, and that his class isn't the end-all, be-all,&nbsp;most important thing in her life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And in my room there are lots of things I CAN do. I can't control the world outside. I can't offer Meg a math class later in the day. I cannot feed her horses (many horses) in the morning or evening. I cannot run 6 race-pace 300's for her. I cannot spirit away her teen trouble.</p>— Monte Syrie (@MonteSyrie) <a href=#>May 16, 2018</a></figure><p>Syrie believed that if he trusted his instincts that Meg would do the right thing, and as a high school teacher who actually believes in a young person, that makes him a unicorn.</p><p>And before you call him crazy, it turns out that trust in his instincts paid off, because Meg ultimately got her work done - there just wasn't enough time in the day for it beforehand.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>But I can give her a break. She was not being rude or disrespectful yesterday when she nodded off. She was tired. So I gave her a break. I can do that. And I want to believe, I have to believe--else my life is a lie, that it will come back in the end. And it did. Meg got her</p>— Monte Syrie (@MonteSyrie) <a href=#>May 16, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>essay done. In fact, serendipitously, she proudly told me so when I ran into her at the grocery store at 6:45 this morning. She was getting some breakfast before her 7:10 math class. She'd been up since 5:00 doing chores. <a href=#>#myroom</a> <a href=#>#project180</a></p>— Monte Syrie (@MonteSyrie) <a href=#>May 16, 2018</a></figure><p>Because if someone with a work ethic like Meg's is dozing off in class, there's probably a reason for it, and Syrie wasn't going to jam her up as a result.</p><p>His tweet thread about busts-her-butt-Meg ended up making the rounds on Twitter, with parents thanking Syrie for his no-ego approach to running his classroom.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You could have written this about my 17 yr old daughter. Teachers like you are such a blessing to our children.</p>— Katherine Willis (@theKatWillis) <a href=#>May 17, 2018</a></figure><p>Other parents shared similar stories about their own kids who struggled with juggling all of their responsibilities, and were thankful that awesome teachers helped them out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My son who is 15 had a mental breakdown on Tuesday and the student success teacher let him sleep in his office and he called me said he did a professional judgement to allow this- I’m thrilled my son has someone he can go to and trust.

Some empathy and compassion can go a long ways. 🙂</p>— Monte Syrie (@MonteSyrie) <a href=#>May 17, 2018</a></figure><p>For this guy, a little bit of understanding and kindness from his high school teacher went a long way. Years later, he still remembers this awesome decision a teacher made after he endured one of the worst days in his life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When I was in HS my bf broke up with me, college applications were due, and I fell apart. I showed up to a test in tears. My teacher took me into the hall, told me it was OK, and sent me home. He let me take the test later. I will NEVER forget his kindness and empathy that day.</p>— Zane Bauer (@ZanePants) <a href=#>May 17, 2018</a></figure><p>Or this other student who was happy their own teacher reacted like Syrie's to her impromptu doze-off session.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you for being kind to her!

The 1st time it happened he came in after school to ask about what he slept through and to thank me.
