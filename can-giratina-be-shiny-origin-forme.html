In case you aren't aware, Shiny Pok√©mon are Pok√©mon with an alternate color scheme than their usual palette. These can range from slightly off-color Pok√©mon or they can amount to completely different-looking versions of well-known creatures.</p><p>In fact, even Legendary Pok√©mon can be Shiny too!</p><p>Shiny Pok√©mon are incredibly difficult to get your hands on in any Pok√©mon, including the mobile ARG title <a href=#>Pok√©mon GO</a>. In GO, the odds of finding a Shiny Pok√©mon are about 1 in 500, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dexterto</a>. If you're lucky enough to get your hands on one, it'd certainly be nice to show off to your friends.</p><p>With the Pok√©mon currently available in raid battles as of this writing, players are wondering if the legendary <a href=#>Giratina</a> can be Shiny in its "Origin Forme." Here's what to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@_Mikhhu</a><p>Giratina Origin Forme in 'Pok√©mon GO'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can Giratina be Shiny in its Origin Forme? Here's what to know in 'Pok√©mon GO'.</h2><p>Giratina is a Legendary Ghost/Dragon Pok√©mon that was first introduced as part of Gen IV in Pok√©mon Platinum. In Pok√©mon lore, it is a member of the "creation trio" in the Sinnoh region and is a very powerful addition to your Pok√©mon collection.</p><p>Interestingly, Giratina's hexapedal form is also known as "Altered Forme" and is considered to be an alternative appearance. If given a Griseous Orb in the game, it will convert into its limbless and ethereal "Origin Forme."</p><p>Giratina Altered Forme was first added to Pok√©mon GO in October 2018 during the Halloween event, with its Origin Forme following in April 2019.</p><p>On Oct. 20, 2022, Giratina Altered Forme was available as a raid boss capture for one week. As of Oct. 27, 2022, Origin Forme is now available for players to capture via raid battles. Giratinas caught by players before Nov. 1 will have the attack "Shadow Force."</p><p>Giratina's Altered Forme has a Shiny version that you can capture, but does Origin Forme have one?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>First hundo Giratina origin forme of this round, and shundo üíØ‚ú®</p><p>Thank you very much my Japanese friend form India, Mr. Masami üôè. <a href=#>#PokemonGO</a> <a href=#>#PokemonGOraid</a> <a href=#>#PokemonGoThailand</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NcuZm6Duk1</a></p>‚Äî MothSkywalker üáπüá≠ (@devilthered) <a href=#>October 31, 2022</a></figure><p>Indeed it does! As opposed to the red accents and gray body that Giratina normally has, Shiny Giratina Origin Forme has aqua-colored stripes and a slightly lighter gray on its body. As opposed to other Shiny Pok√©mon, Giratina's Shiny version stands in stark contrast to its original design.</p><p>Beating a Giratina Origin Forme during a raid battle will be its own challenge, but here's hoping you can find a Shiny version before the event ends.</p><p>Giratina Origin Forme raid battles in Pok√©mon GO will be available until Nov. 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vecaiqZqsmaOubq7EZqqhoZ6uerC%2ByKCgp2WWpL%2BusQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./xolo-mariduena-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Xolo Mariduea - Idade, Vida Pessoal, Biografia</span></a>
