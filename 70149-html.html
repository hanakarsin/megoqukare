Muhammadu&nbsp;Buhari&nbsp;was almost&nbsp;killed&nbsp;in the second bomb explosion that happened few hours after the first attack.</p><p>A source informed that more than&nbsp;20 persons&nbsp;were killed in the attack.</p><p>PM News had quoted Kaduna police chief, Umar Shehu, who confirmed that the two explosions occurred in about 3-hour interval.</p><p>On the first blast, Shehu said:</p><p><i>"We have recorded a blast which is apparently a suicide blast targeting the convoy of Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi. Twenty-five people have so far been confirmed dead."</i></p><p>Also, Premium Times reported that the first explosion occurred in the afternoon along Isa Kaita road leading to the popular Murtala Square.</p><p>PM News reported Bauchi was driving in an open-roofed truck, greeting well-wishers who had assembled for the closing of a prominent Koranic festival.</p><p>Premium Times recalls that Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi, a known critic of the Boko Haram sect,&nbsp;<a href=#>was previously targeted, however it is unclear wether Boko Haram are responsible for the explosion</a>.</p><p>A witness identified as Hassan Mohammed said the bomb was hidden in a red Volkswagen golf car parked by the road side adding it detonated as Sheikh's convoy drove past. While Sheikh was not hurt in the attack, many other people were reportedly killed:</p><p><i>"As I speak to you now, I can see many bodies on the ground."&nbsp;</i></p><p>Data on the number of casualties are controversial. Eyewitnesses and humanitarian workers informed Sahara Reporters that the death toll&nbsp;from both explosions has&nbsp;risen over&nbsp;50. As&nbsp;of&nbsp;the time of this report, thousands were rushing to their homes following a 24-hour curfew imposed on the town.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Kaduna-based official of the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, informed Vanguard reporter that the second bomb blast killed at least 17 people.</p><p><i>“We are still working on the figures but so far we have 17 dead,”</i> said Musa Illela, referring specifically to the second attack which he described as<i> “a bomb blast".</i></p><p><strong><i>Second explosion:</i></strong></p><p>Leadership confirmed the development saying that about 3 hours after the first bomb went off, another bomb explosion rocked the popularly Kawo Motor Park in the Crocodile City.</p><p>Reuters puts the number of people killed in both attacks to 82 (32 and 50, respectively).</p><p>BBC reporter says the second attack targeted the motorcade of senior opposition leader General Muhammadu Buhari.</p><p>According to the reporter, gunmen rammed a vehicle into his convoy, firing shots at it, adding that three of Gen. Buhari's aides and several security personnel travelling with him were slightly wounded in the attack. A former military ruler of Nigeria is unhurt in the incident, though he is reportedly traumatised morally by the development.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHF9k3JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./veronica-cat-road-trip.html><span>←</span><span>Animals | Distractify.com</span></a>
