Everyone from performers to those who work in the industry. They're expected to pair off as couples on the show to then compete in a series of challenges until only one couple is left standing. The couples' "dates" will include live performances and duets, with the intent to "reveal the couple‚Äôs love and devotion to one another," Deadline says.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The first season will premiere in April.</h2><p>In between the end of The Bachelor season and the premiere of the next <a href=#>Bachelorette</a>, The Bachelor: Listen to Your Heart is currently set to premiere its first season on April 13 in the 8-10 p.m. EST time slot the franchise usually shows in.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an attempt to capture that love and motion and music are intertwined.

He admitted that he was hoping being on the show would launch his music career, with the greenlight from his girlfriend, of course.
