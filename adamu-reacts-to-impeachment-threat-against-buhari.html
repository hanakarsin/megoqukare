With the National Assembly, we expect this hit. It happens everywhere, in every democracy. When you get on it, you keep hitting at it, hitting at it. Even those who initiated it are no longer on that track.”</p><p>Speaking on the ongoing ASUU strike, Adamu said while the party appreciated the Muhammadu Buhari government, he hoped ASUU would be realistic with their demands.</p><p>“I do know and I appreciate the effort government is making, and it’s my hope that ASUU will come to reality with the government.
