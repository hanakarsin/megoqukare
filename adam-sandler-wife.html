It's the film where the two met, in fact.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the scene</a>, Jackie — playing a waitress in a bar — goes up to little Julian (played by the <a href=#>Sprouse twins</a>) to see what he's doing there alone at a table. He says he's watching football, and when she asks who he's rooting for, he says, "The goddamn Jets." She laughs and tells him to have fun.</p><p>Since then, Jackie has gone on to appear in many of her husband's films, in addition to numerous other projects. But who is she? Let's meet Jackie.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@adamsandler</a><p>Jackie and Adam in an undated throwback</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Adam Sandler's wife, Jackie (Titone) Sandler?</h2><p>Jackie Titone was born in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coral Gables, Fla., in 1974</a>, and reportedly worked as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">model in Brazil</a> before eventually transitioning into acting. She got her first role in the aforementioned Big Daddy, where she met her future hubs.</p><p>After that, Jackie went on to appear in numerous comedies (not all of them Adam's, FYI) including Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo, Duplex, Paul Blart: Mall Cop, and Grown Ups. In more recent years, she made a brief appearance as a flight attendant in Murder Mystery, and she had a larger role as the hilariously awful villain in Netflix's The Wrong Missy. (Seriously, she's great in it.)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Jackie and Adam in March 2023</p></figure><p>Off-screen, Jackie makes sure her husband — for whom she converted to Judaism ahead of their 2003 wedding — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eats well</a>, and she encourages him to take roles he doesn't think he has the guts for. Case in point? The critically acclaimed <a href=#>Uncut Gems</a>.</p><p>Adam explained on <a href=#>the Ellen show</a> in 2019, "I read [the script] and I loved the movie but I was scared to do it." He said that after talking to Jackie — whom he discusses all of his roles with — he decided to jump in after she gave him the "strength and the courage."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adam Sandler and his wife Jackie have two kids.</h2><p>Adam and Jackie are the proud parents to two girls. Their eldest, Sadie, was born in 2006; younger sis Sunny followed in late 2008.</p><p>Like their mama, the girls have appeared in some of Dad's flicks too. In fact, they've been appearing in movies since they were toddlers. We'll be seeing them again soon in Adam's upcoming <a href=#>Netflix</a> project You Are SO Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Adam, Sunny, Sadie, a friend, and Jackie in March 2023</p></figure><p>As the girls continue to figure out their own careers, it looks like they want to forge their own paths. Adam said on The Drew Barrymore Show in 2020 that they don't want to just keep appearing in his films. "They want to do their own thing one day," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>.</p><p>We look forward to seeing more from this adorable fam.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrGiuYysmKecnJq%2FbsPIn5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-chris-rooney.html><span>←</span><span>TikTok Star Chris Rooney Has Been Found After He Briefly Seemed to Go Missing</span></a>
