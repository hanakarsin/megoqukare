Saturn is the planetary ruler of the Capricorn, but as you were born in the second Decan, or part, of the sign, you also receive a generous helping of Venus's planetary power. Being the planet of control, Saturn's influence is reflected in your determined and disciplined qualities. Venus's influence is more heavily tied to harmony and is linked to your appreciation of beauty and social qualities. Your unique combination of planetary influences makes you far more social, creative and adaptable than the other Capricorn Decans.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Top Boko Haram Commander Surrenders To Troops In Borno</h2><time>Feb 2, 2024</time>
