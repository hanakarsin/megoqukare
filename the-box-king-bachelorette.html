The reality dating show competition will surely be full of drama, fights, and hookups. And, we can’t wait to watch it all go down on the ABC series. &nbsp;</p><p>Now, ahead of the show’s Season 15 premiere, one guy already has fans talking. His name: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe “Box King” Barsano</a> will make his grand entrance on tonight’s Bachelorette, and you surely won’t want to miss his first impression. Here's what you need to know Joe.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">First, what is a “Box King?”&nbsp;</h2><p>Joe Barsano hails from the windy city of Chicago, and is supposedly known as the “Box King.” The 30-year-old is ready to settle down and share his throne with Hannah B. Joe inherited the family business and works as an account representative for their cardboard box business. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>One of the biggest episodes of the series is the arrival of each contestant. And the so-called king does something fans have never seen … he arrives as a package. Yes, he enters inside of a cardboard box filled with packing peanuts. Hey, maybe this is the delivery of Hannah’s dreams, or possibly someone she’s ready to ship out of her life forever. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joe enjoys gambling… a lot.&nbsp;</h2><p>Joe loves high stake situations and taking risks, which is great for someone betting his heart on a widely popular reality television show. According to his bio, this Italian boy loves taking trips to Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“He is also a whiz on the blackjack and craps tables,” reads his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC profile.</a> Apparently, partying in Vegas is high on Joe’s activity list as he’s even traveled to Sin City four times in the past year. While this place may be the Chicago-native’s favorite city in the world, Hannah may not be such a fan.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">&nbsp;Will Joe the “Box King” win The Bachelorette? (Spoilers &nbsp;Ahead)</h2><p>While it is still unknown who Hannah B. picks to be her Prince Charming, we do know the four guys who receive a hometown date with the pageant princess.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the blonde beauty decided to ship Joe back with the rest of his boxes. According to Reality Steve, <a href=#>the final four men</a> will be Luke Parker, Jed Wyatt, Tyler Cameron, and Peter Weber. &nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Joe still has a few ladies in his life — his adorable nieces who clearly love their uncle. Plus, there might be a chance Joe makes it to Bachelor in Paradise this summer!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As for Hannah, we don’t know who (if anyone) she will end up choosing, but we do hope she finally gets her happy ending.&nbsp;</p><p>"She’s not going to fake this. She’s not going to just tell everybody what they want to hear or just get engaged for the show. She’s really going to let it happen and if it doesn’t happen on her own time and in her own way, then it won’t," &nbsp;Chris Harrison told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "So that’s why I tell you that, at this point, I don’t know how it’s going to end."&nbsp;</p><p>Watch The Bachelorette Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecGor2ajmaO0bq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BnsrXAxA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-real-housewives-taglines.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Real Housewives Taglines Ever</span></a>
