We don’t want to be worsted, or have our nose bloodied at all. But life is not so. You win some, and you lose some. That was what happened to Nigeria last Sunday, though rather painfully.</p><p>“I have read many silly, idiotic and imbecilic comments, trying to link the loss to the video conference the President had with the players on Sunday morning. Witless. Thoughtless.</p><p>“And incidentally, if the Super Eagles had gone into the match without encouragement from their President, the same people would have come out to condemn the leader of the country for being taciturn and insensitive. Head or tail, you never win with some Nigerians.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FxZqyhnKHGbrXDoqatoZNiwam71KCfraSVqMBussSmoGaZlJrAqrrAZpmlmaOpwG7Ax6iqnmWnnbxursuapJ6cXZfCqa3Roqpmm5GhuW6yzqtkrK2gmr9uscCgo56rXZazpLvNZpyxoaRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./september3-html.html><span>←</span><span>September 3 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
