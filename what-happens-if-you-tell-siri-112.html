You can practically handle all of your phone tasks with voice automation software on Android, and the more you actively speak to your phone and have it recognize your speech patterns, the better its software gets at recognizing what you're saying. Plus, it's also fun to just mess around with a robot if you're bored, but whatever you do, don't tell <a href=#>Siri</a> "112." You probably won't like what happens.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happens when you tell Siri 112?</h2><p>If you're from Europe, then you know that "112" is the shorthand phone number to dial emergency services. So even if you're stateside and you're out and about with your iPhone, dialing 112 in a sticky situation that requires help on the double will get Siri to call 911 on your behalf (though it's important to note that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not all cell carriers in the U.S.</a> recognize 112 as an emergency number). It's also a great secret way to call the cops if you're in a bind without alerting others to the fact that you're asking for help.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This goes without saying, but don't tell Siri to dial 112 just for the heck of it.</h2><p>If you don't know the boy who cried wolf story, now's a good time to catch up on it and learn the vital lesson: You shouldn't be calling 911 for a situation that isn't an emergency, so dialing 112 via Siri just for the heck of it is a prime way to ensure that you're getting in a ton of trouble.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The penalties for "prank" calling 911 when there really isn't an emergency are extremely severe and vary depending on the nature of your call. Let's say you dialed up emergency services for a situation that didn't necessitate the need for police to report to the scene. If you're found guilty of abusing the system, you could spend up to a year in county jail and get fined up to $1,000. But that's not all.</p><p>If you falsely report or exaggerate great bodily harm, injury, or death, then that fine can go all the way up to $10,000 and three years in a county jail. So you definitely want to think twice before dialing those emergency services.</p><p>It's important to note that other countries' emergency services numbers will also work in Siri: 108 (India) and 119 (South Korea) will also trigger 911, so keep that in mind.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aye, somebody with an iPhone do me a favor, ask it to show you a picture of an idiot üòÇ bruh ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>‚Äî Black Bonnieüñ§ (@SimplyAlexis83) <a href=#>November 19, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Siri previously made headlines when folks asked it to "show me a picture of an idiot."</h2><p>Voice assistants are plugged into the web for populating results, and they will enlist the help of search engines to do so. It's no secret that the most widely used search engine in the world is Google. So Siri, along with Google Assistant (duh) and Samsung's "annoying" Bixby, will usually pull results from Google in order to get content to their users.</p><p>In 2020, folks began talking about what happened when you asked Siri to show you a picture of an idiot.
