I told him during his courtesy call that my prayer is that himself or Prof Umeadi of APGA would win, why not? That is from my heart, but I also told him that my head and facts on the ground led me to know that its probability is next to zero (what I cannot say before you, I won’t say behind you). So I already told him my opinion. Indeed, there is no credible pathway for him near the first two positions, and if care is not taken, he won’t even near the third position.”</p><h2>Elections Are Not Won On Social Media</h2><p>Speaking further, Soludo cautioned that large social media followership does not automatically translate to election victory.</p><p>He added that Obi and his party should have seen the signs with the outcome of the governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun States.</p><p>“Analysts tell him you don’t need “structure” to win. Fantasy! Of course, LP won governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun on social media and via phantom polls, while getting barely 2,000 votes on ground. Creating a credible third force for presidential election in Nigeria requires a totally different strategy and extreme hard work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BtZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm67waJkppmpYruwwIyerZ6mXZi8rrGMrZ%2BiqpRiwLC41J2mZpyVmLmivsSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaffy-bello.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Shaffy Bello On Naija News</span></a>
