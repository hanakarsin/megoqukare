The&nbsp;feeling of your heart dropping in your chest is like no other. It's the worst feeling in the world. My wallet was stolen in the middle of Europe once, and it was a mess. So when Tim's wallet went missing on his way home from work the other day, he felt like it was a lost cause.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially because he didn't have much identifying info in there.&nbsp;He thought it was gone forever. But surprisingly,&nbsp;a good Samaritan picked it up and found a creative way to get in touch with him. Tim posted the screenshot to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, a message sent through small deposits to his bank account.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>There may not have been in ID with a name or an address in Tim's wallet, but there was a credit card,&nbsp;and according to Tim, it's standard in the UK for your account details to be printed on your bank card.&nbsp;</p><p>So the nice person who happened upon Tim's wallet decided to make four £0.01 payments into his account and add a message in the reference section. The full message reads, "Hi! I found your wallet in the road," with a phone number to text or call to get it back. How brilliant is that?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I'm not sure, had I found Tim's wallet in the road, that I would have been creative enough to figure out how to get a message to him without any identifying information at my fingertips. I wonder if this person is some sort of detective or something.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim posted the screenshot to Twitter where it went totally viral and garnered lots of impressed reactions.&nbsp;People&nbsp;started sharing their own heartwarming stories of incidents where&nbsp;their precious items were lost and then returned by people who put in a lot of effort to find them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>No word on how this "big scary" guy found them, but when you hear stories like this, stories of people taking the extra effort to do something good for a stranger, it warms your heart, doesn't it?&nbsp;</p><p>Here's another cute one,&nbsp;from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah</a>: "My daughter lost her bag with purse in it while on holiday in Portugal. Someone found her through Facebook, messaged her, and posted it back to the UK. We told him to use the money in the purse to post it, when it arrived it was all still in there."&nbsp;</p><p>They even used their&nbsp;own money to mail the bag back to Hannah's daughter. Stuff like this makes me hopeful for humanity, you know? You hear a lot of negative stories these days, but this is just pure goodness.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Tim's heartwarming (and very impressive) story&nbsp;led to a whole thread of people sharing similar things, which is even more awesome than the original story itself. There are good people all over the world who will step up and make the effort for people they've never even met, and that is a beautiful thing.&nbsp;</p><p>This lost wallet tale definitely inspired me to try to go out and pay it forward, to bring kindness out into the world and to also practice my MacGyver / Sherlock Holmes skills in case I need them someday soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7K1wdGnnJ1lnKTAtXnWmqOlnaQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-igbos-were-against-obasanjo-presidency-but-it-is-time-for-them-to-rule-olu-falae.html><span>←</span><span>The Igbos Were Against Obasanjo Presidency, But It Is Time For Them To Rule</span></a>
