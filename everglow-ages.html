She was born on May 19, 1998, which makes her 22 years old, and she's — shockingly — one of the oldest in the group. She was the fifth band member to be revealed when the band debuted in March 2019, and prior to Everglow's debut, she was modeling for STARE Shoes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Sihyeon</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Sihyeon (birth name: Kim Sihyeon) was born on Aug. 5, 1999, which makes her 21 years old as of publication.

Mia grew up dancing and eventually landed a spot in the group as a main vocalist and a main dancer. She's also apparently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in charge of "girl crush,"</a> &nbsp;which according to Korean Celeb Gossip, is a concept that inspires the band's image.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Aisha</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Aisha (birth name: Heo Yoorim) was born on July 21, 2000, which also makes her a 20-year-old Cancer. Prior to Everglow's debut, she trained with the popular South Korean entertainment agency JYP. She also grew up with a passion for dance, and hoped that one day, she would take over the entire music scene in Asia, which inspired her stage name, Aisha.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Yiren</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Yiren (birth name: Wang Yiren) plays a number of roles in the K-pop group, from lead dancer, to sub vocalist, sub rapper, visual, center, face of the group, and Maknae. She was born on Dec. 29, 2000, which makes her the youngest of the group at only 19 years old. Prior to debuting with the group at 18, she trained on Produce 48, and studied dance for 10 years. Despite her young age, she is incredibly qualified to be in the band.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Onda</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Onda (birth name: Jo Serim) is the group's lead dancer, sub vocalist, and visual artist.
