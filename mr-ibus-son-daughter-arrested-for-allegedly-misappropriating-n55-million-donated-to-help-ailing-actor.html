Mr. Ibu’s wife, Mrs Stella Maris Chinyere Okafor, was initially managing the funds to defray Mr. Ibu’s medical bills and sustain the family. However, along the line, the duo of Onyeabuchi Daniel Okafor and Jasmine Chioma Okekeagwu manipulated Mrs Stella Maris Chinyere Okafor, took possession of Mr. Ibu’s phone, and hacked into the banking details therein,” the Police said.</p><p>The FCID Spokesperson, ASP Mayegun Aminat, elaborated on how the duo reinstalled the banking app on Okafor’s phone and transferred N55 million from donations intended for the actor’s medical expenses.</p><p>The Police revealed that Okafor and Jasmine had orchestrated a sham marriage at the Ikoyi registry and had also applied for visas to depart the country.</p><p>“They thereafter re-installed the mobile banking applications of Mr. Ibu on the phone of Onyeabuchi Daniel Okafor preparatory to the perfection of their preconceived fraudulent plans and wiped off the banking applications originally installed on Mr. Ibu’s phone, thereby, taking direct and full charge of banking activities of Mr. Ibu in relation to the funds being donated by members of the public in support of his medicals.</p><p>“Through this fraudulent act, Onyeabuchi Daniel Okafor and Jasmine Chioma Okekeagwu started transferring funds from Mr. Ibu’s public fundraising account to Onyeabuchi Daniel Okafor’s personal bank with forensic analysis of their illicit financial dealing establishing that a total of fifty five million naira (=N=55M) has been successfully and criminally transferred prior to their arrest and investigation.</p><p>“Investigation also unearthed text messages via WhatsApp between Jasmine Chioma and Daniel Okafor detailing in stage-by-stage how they conspired and hatched their criminal plans. It was also established that the two suspects, Jasmine Chioma Okekeagwu and Onyeabuchi Daniel Okafor, had a sham marriage at the Ikoyi Marriage Registry with plans to escape from the country to the UK, where they intended to settle with their proceeds of crime. They already applied for a UK Visa in furtherance to this plan prior to their arrest,” the statement added.</p><p>The FCID announced that a sum of N50 million has been recovered from the suspects. Additionally, they disclosed that both individuals have been charged at the Chief Magistrate Court 1, Yaba, under Charge No. A/06/2024 for conspiracy and stealing.</p><p>“During investigation, the stolen fifty-five million naira (=N=55M) was traced to the Bank Account of Onyeabuchi Daniel Okafor wherein it was discovered that they had squandered a total of five million naira (=N=5M) on questionable transactions, while the balance total of fifty million (=N=50M) has been recovered from him.</p><p>“On the strength of evidence, Onyeabuchi Daniel Okafor and Jasmine Chioma Okekeagwu have been charged to the Chief Magistrate Court 1, Yaba, in Charge No. A/06/2024 for conspiracy and stealing. They were granted bail in the sum of =N= 15m with two sureties in like sum while the case was adjourned to 11th March, 2024.
