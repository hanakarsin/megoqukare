Unfortunately, now all of the spoilers are out there.</p><p>If you were hoping to go into Xenoblade Chronicles 3 blind and without any spoilers, then don't read ahead.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set in Aionios, a world containing the two nations Keves and Agnus. You'll play as both Noah from Keves and Mio from Agnus.</p><p>Unlike the franchise's other installments, players will be able to switch out which character they're using in combat with the game's new overhauled combat style.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit threads</a>, the censored hero whom players keep seeing in the game's trailers is actually Ethel. You'll lose her as a hero early on in the game though — and there are a few other characters who will die and only be part of your team for a short period of time. Cammuravi will also die by Chapter 4, so while you have these characters on your team, take advantage of their skills in combat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Xenoblade 3 has OFFICIALLY LEAKED!

Many of them have been uploaded to different online forums and on YouTube, making them readily available to anyone who wants the spoilers.</p><p>This, of course, also means that there are details of the game's cutscenes all over the internet, and if you don't want them, it's time to log off until the game is released for the Switch on July 29.</p><p>That being said, there currently aren't any leaks for the expansion pass that's already been announced for the future of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, so even if you spoil the main storyline for yourself, there will be plenty of new content to keep it interesting. Some have said they're holding out for the expansion pack before they dive in, hoping to keep the game interesting with as few spoilers as possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrbKvu8GlmJ2dXZi1s7vNopqlnaNigG6%2Fz6igpZ2iqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./we-no-dey-come-back-nigeria-popular-security-guards-replies-apostle-chibuzor.html><span>←</span><span>'We No Dey Come Back Nigeria'</span></a>
