When you get to the US, the number one democratic nation, you’ve seen Trump, you know his age, you’ve Joe Biden, you know his age. Age has nothing to do with it, it’s just a number.</p><p>“So, he (Tinubu) has the capacity, he is coming to the table with a lot of experience and you cannot ignore that. What we should do is pray for him. I don’t think he is older than Biden, I don’t think he is older than the former President Trump.</p><p>“He is 69, that’s his age. Even if he is 70, he is qualified, even if he is 80, he is qualified. So long as he is physically fit and he has the mental alertness to do the job.”</p><p>Igbokwe said he will be rooting for APC national leader to emerge as the party’s flag bearer at the APC National Convention in February, dismissing talks of conflict of choice between Osinbajo and Tinubu.</p><p>He added: “It is the party that will decide, we will go to the national convention, whoever emerges, we’ll support that person because only one candidate will be fielded by the APC; it can be Asiwaju (Tinubu), it can be Osinbajo, it can be Umahi but as I speak to you now, my voter’s card is in my pocket and I am going to use it to vote for Asiwaju if he wins the primary.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FwZmtoYmh6tbXNrpmuZaCdxrS1wpqjpbFdm7a1edOhmKdlnZa7unnYqKytoKNitqiuzqSunmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-dss-dgs-wife-threatened-me-vowed-to-prevent-me-from-becoming-governor.html><span>←</span><span>'How DSS DGs Wife Threatened Me, Vowed To Prevent Me From Becoming Governor'</span></a>
