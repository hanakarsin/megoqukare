Hence invoking Section 43 of the Act, which states in part that for the period a worker withdraws his services, his employers have the right not to pay his wages is in order. The ILO principles at work, further supports this.</p><p>“Mr. Lukman has therefore displayed his shallow knowledge of labour dispute resolution and management by alleging that Ministers Ngige and Ehanire could have proactively stopped this strike and even went further to castigate Ngige over the Kaduna State Government/NLC dispute, which led to a four-day strike.”</p><p>Ngige further argued that the resident doctors, as essential workers, were not expected to go on strike without giving at least 15 days notice to him as the Labour Minister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5BpZp2nk6m8s7%2BMrKuroZuaeq%2BzyKCcZquclrq0ecCpmmafn6vAbrLOq6ymZZSceqe70WaYrKOZo7RutMimZK2nXaeytLXGp2Saq12itq%2B10q2cq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./denis-mcdonough-html.html><span>←</span><span>Denis McDonough - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
