The Season 2 premiere, titled “Trying to Get to Heaven Before They Close the Door,” airs tonight, Sunday, Jan. 9, at 9 p.m. on the premium cable network.</p><p>And in what’s becoming a rarity in this era of streaming TV, Euphoria comes out weekly instead of releasing entire seasons at once.</p><p>That means that if you want to watch all of Euphoria Season 2 at once, you’ll have to wait until the second-season finale airs. (If HBO airs one episode of the second season each week and doesn’t skip a week, then the eighth and final episode of the season will air on Sunday, Feb. 27.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You can watch ‘Euphoria’ each week on HBO, HBO Max, or even Hulu.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Eddy Chen/HBO</span></figure><p>If you’re ready for Season 2 of Euphoria, you have a few options for how to watch the new episodes. Not only will each Euphoria episode air on HBO each Sunday at 9 p.m., but <a href=#>HBO Max</a> will start streaming each episode at the same time. So if HBO isn’t included in your cable plan, you can subscribe to HBO Max for $9.99 monthly or $99.99 yearly for the ad-supported plan or $14.99 monthly or $149.99 annually for the ad-free plan.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get a free, one-week trial to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulu with HBO Max</a> if you don’t already have a Hulu account. Just know that it’s $14.99 per month after the first week, so you might want to time your Euphoria viewing carefully if you want to cancel the trial before getting charged.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The ‘Euphoria’ cast and creator have given us a sense of how “brutal” Season 2 will be.</h2><p>HBO isn’t saying much about Euphoria Season 2. In fact, its logline for the new season is almost maddeningly vague: “Amidst the intertwining lives in the town of East Highland, 17-year-old Rue must find hope while balancing the pressures of love, loss, and addiction.”</p><p>But Euphoria star <a href=#>Zendaya</a> and creator <a href=#>Sam Levinson</a> have been a bit more forthcoming. For her part, Zendaya told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a> last July that Season 2, which she was currently filming, is a “challenging season.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>“It’s gonna be hard, and it’s gonna be devastating sometimes,” she added. “But I think Rue really deserves all of that care when it comes to her character, because I think she represents a lot for so many people. And I hope to make those people proud with our depictions of Rue [and] where all the characters go. I think this season’s not going to be easy, though. It’s not going to be a fun watch, I don’t think.”</p><p>And Sam spoke along similar lines, while praising Euphoria’s lead star, in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">British Vogue</a> in September. “It’s such a brutal season, and what I love the most about [Zendaya] is she’s able to go to those dark places, and then as soon as I call cut, she’s hanging out behind the monitor, eating Cheesecake Factory, and cracking jokes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yerKmgn6e2onnCqKSeZZ%2BqwW7DxJ6ipbE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1164669-how-find-true-love-according-bible-html.html><span>←</span><span>How to find true love according to the Bible</span></a>
