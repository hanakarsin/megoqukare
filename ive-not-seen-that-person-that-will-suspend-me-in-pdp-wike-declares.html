A state that provided the Governor? A State that brought three Senators? A State that produced 32 Assembly members? A State that produced 11 out of 13 House of Reps.</p><p>“The person that wants to suspend me is the one that couldn’t produce a Governor or three Senators or Assembly. I’ve not seen that person that will suspend me in PDP. Nobody will do it.</p><p>“Who will discipline me? I should be the one calling for discipline for those who violated the party’s constitution on rotation. I want to dare anyone who will say I should be suspended. I’m a man of character.</p><p>As earlier reported by <strong>Naija News</strong>, Wike said he obtained permission from the PDP before accepting Tinubu’s ministerial appointment, adding that he worked in the interest of justice, equity, and fairness.</p><p>“I wrote to my party about my nomination, and they replied that I should accept it. Forget about their rantings, they are all regretting their actions, and that’s what led the party to what it is today. I worked in favour of justice, equity and fairness,” he said.</p><h2>Some APC Members Not Happy With My Appointment</h2><p>Speaking further, Wike said some members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are not happy that he was given a ministerial appointment by President Tinubu. The former Rivers State Governor however declared that despite the development, he remains a member of the PDP.</p><p>“God supports the action we’ve taken to support President Tinubu. Some APC members are not happy that I’m FCT minister. At my level, do I need to play game? Why will you put my name? I’m still a member of PDP. I’m not a kid, if I want to play a role, I will. I’m not a member of APC,” Wike submitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5JpZqKulWK7sMCMrJyepl2ptaLAjKmcq6ufo3q1tMCtZLChnKF6tMHSqZynnF2ism61zWannahdrLassYydnJykkaeytHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ooni-of-ife-welcomes-his-new-queen-olori-mariam-anako-into-the-palace.html><span>←</span><span>Ooni Of Ife Welcomes His New Queen, Olori Mariam Anako, Into The Palace</span></a>
