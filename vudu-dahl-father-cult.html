But we ain’t here for that," owner Danny "KP" Kirkpatrick told the camera. "It’s about culture, families, art, and hope. I’m tryin’ to bring everybody together."</p><p>Viewers immediately took a liking to tattoo apprentice <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vudu Dahl</a> (pronounced "doll"), who has a, shall we say, very unique background.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Vudu Dahl’s stepfather was the leader of a cult.</h2><p>The makeup artist grew up in a religious commune near Seattle, which she described as a "very sheltered" existence. "I wasn’t allowed to have any friends. There was no TV, no literature. And when I left, it was the most liberating thing that I could have ever experienced," Vudu explained on the show.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>"Soon as I got out, I was like, 'Yes!' Like I am this wild, fun-loving person," the beauty, who specializes in erotic art, shared. "And now that I’ve become myself, I guess, like, people would consider me sexualized."</p><p>Vudu added that she’s often considered the "life of the party" and loves to pose for photographers and be naked. "It’s fun for me," she said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Black Ink Crew Compton star is openly queer.</h2><p>The lingerie-loving model opened up about her sexuality at the beginning of Pride Month. "Growing up in a homophobic household, I was VERY confused about my sexual and gender identity for a long time and holy s--t, it’s been a journey trying to figure it out!!!" Vudu admitted.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"When I was 7, I had a crush on Lucy Lawless from Xena and my mom’s friend’s daughter. I felt so guilty and it made me depressed and suicidal," she recalled. "Then around 19, I came out as lesbian to my parents and that was a f--king disaster. I was laughed at and made fun of and was told I was confused…"</p><p>Vudu shared that a year later, she almost married a man who wanted to transition to female and she's since dated all different kinds of people.&nbsp;</p><p>"So now, I’m pretty sure I’m pansexual," she stated. "I’m still not totally sure about my gender identity but I feel I’m 'part girl, part boy' and I love my body and all of [its] weird quirkiness."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Vudu also revealed that she struggles with an eating disorder.</h2><p>The reality star told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram followers</a> that she’s been battling anorexia for nearly half her life. In a July 23 post, she wrote, "This past week I’ve been finally up to eating three meals a day! And I feel f--king amazing… I know it’s only been a week, but I want to allow myself to celebrate every victory no matter how small!"</p><p>Vudu continued, "I have [a] high metabolism so I’m naturally thin, but when I don’t eat I look really unwell, I feel weak, and I’m exhausted all the time." In a separate post she added, "I would really love to get into fitness modeling once I gain a bit more weight but I’m thankful to be where I’m at now."</p><p>We’re all about that positivity!
