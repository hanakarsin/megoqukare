Read on for the details of the incident that everyone is talking about — and how the cringey event is <a href=#>tied to Barbie</a>-mania.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happened to Don Geronimo?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WUSA9</a>, iHeartRadio, which owns the local D.C.-based radio station that aired The Don Geronimo Show, has confirmed that Don no longer works for them.</p><p>The <a href=#>shocking termination</a> happened after Don make what are being described as "disparaging" remarks about Sharla at Commanders training camp in late July 2023.</p><p>"Hey look, Barbie's here," Don joked about the blonde interviewer live on air.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Hi Barbie girl," he doubled down, going on to further insert his foot in his mouth by puzzlingly commenting, "I'm guessing she's a cheerleader." Don also referred to Sharla as "that chick."</p><p>Not surprisingly, the sexist off-the-cuff and not-so-funny jokes didn't go down well with his employers, and his job was quickly eliminated.</p><p>As Aaron Hyland, iHeartMedia’s D.C. regional president, explained in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, “After an internal review, Don Geronimo is no longer an employee of WBIG. We take matters of this nature very seriously and this behavior does not align with our core values.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Don Geronimo has shared some insight into his reaction to the firing.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>At this time I will not be providing comment on the events of the last few days.

No woman should experience this in the workplace, and I appreciate the Commanders’ swift response in handling this matter.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Social media is divided on Don Geronimo's firing.</h2><p>Interestingly, Don found many supporters on social media following his head-scratching and disrespectful comments <a href=#>about a co-worker</a>. Many people felt what he said did not rise to the level of being fired as a result, with one Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, "Seriously? Fired for calling someone a Barbie girl. How damn ludicrous."</p><p>However, some folks felt the decision to terminate him was completely justified.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Accurate reflection”?
