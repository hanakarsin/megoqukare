A group of 15 singles convenes in a Las Vegas villa, pairing up in hopes of hitting it off in the face of some serious drama and unexpected plot twists that can be attributed to the producers.</p><p>As single contestants who haven't paired up are voted off of the show, couples inch closer to claiming true love (and a hefty cash prize, which was $100,000 in Season 1). Among the Season 4 hopefuls is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mackenzie Dipman</u></a>, who fans are eager to see return to the series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s what we know about Mackenzie Dipman from 'Love Island USA.'</h2><p>As mentioned, Mackenzie turned heads right out of the gate in Season 2. She’s now a 25-year-old student living in Scottsdale, Ariz. whose dating history includes a long list of millionaires. According to her show bio, she’s into rescue pups, sports, and Matthew McConaughey — her longtime celebrity crush. She says she’s a sucker for Southern gentlemen.</p><p>Mackenzie also isn't afraid to speak her mind, saying that if she could write her own dating bio, it would read, "Unpopular opinions: whipped cream is not sexy or tasty, disco is the best genre, three cups of coffee a day is good for you, Tom Brady is not the GOAT."</p><p>Meanwhile, her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram profile</u></a> playfully says, “Brb looking for love in Las Vegas.. 💕” Her feed is full of barely there bathing suits, see-through outfits, and all the cleavage, and 120,000 fans are here for it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>thinking about you.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>MACKENZIE DIPMAN</a> (@mackenziedipman) on Jun 23, 2020 at 1:59pm PDT</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But she says she’s not what people expect.</h2><p>“The most common thing that I ever hear when people meet me is, ‘You were not what I expected,’” she shared in her official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>show intro video</u></a>, posted on Aug. 23, 2020.</p><p>“They see the blonde hair, the big boobs, the big eyes, the big lips, and they’re like, ‘Oh, this girl is gonna be another dumb blonde joke.’ But I’m not. There’s a lot more to me.”</p><p>To back up these claims, she goes on to cite her sports knowledge. She says she’s genuinely looking for someone to watch the game, drink beer, and eat pizza with, and wants a real connection.</p><p>“I know that I’m the total package, and if a guy is lucky enough to figure that out, then we’ll see how it goes,” she says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mackenzie is planning for a Season 4 return.</h2><p>Season 2 may be in the past, but Mackenzie isn't done with the show yet. She'll be on again in Season 4, though Peacock hasn't announced exactly when she'll show up.</p><p>She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>: "I just think it's going to be a lot more fun this time around, a lot less pressure. I think that's just one of the luxuries of getting a little bit older is that you just kind of learn to let go of certain insecurities."</p><p>Catch up on Love Island USA Tuesdays through Saturdays at 9pm ET on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6kt8SnsaKdXaG8t7GMoqqlmZ6Zera%2FwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daddy-freeze-reveals-who-helped-burna-boys-to-nomination.html><span>←</span><span>Daddy Freeze Reveals Who Helped Burna Boy</span></a>
