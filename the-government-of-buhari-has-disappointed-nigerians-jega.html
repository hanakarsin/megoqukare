He still has time to correct things if he has the capacity to do that. Frankly, his government has been very disappointing,” he said.</p><p>“Governance has been very poor at the federal level and many of the states, that is why we are seeing challenges everywhere; whether it is insurgency, banditry, armed robbery or other things.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports Jega who was appointed INEC chairman by former President <strong>Goodluck Jonathan</strong>, presided over the presidential election in which <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Muhammadu Buhari</a></strong> defeated Jonathan in 2015. He was also in charge during the 2011 elections.</p><p>Few years down the line, he has now come out openly to say many Nigerians are worried “about the direction the country is taking.”</p><p>Earlier, <strong>Naija News</strong> had reported that Jega, on Thursday, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>blamed governance</a></strong> for the call for the restructuring of Nigeria.</p><p>He said, “After a critical evaluation of the benefits versus the costs of each of these notions of restructuring, I believe that the starting point of desirable and serious, even realistic, restructuring is equitable redistribution of power and resources from the Federal Government to the sub-national governments.”</p><p>The former INEC chairman, however, noted that changing the current structure and going back to the pre-1966 regional structure, the 12 states of 1976/77 or making use of six geo-political regions are unrealistic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5FtZq2glWK0sMLEq6WmnZ6perCyjJusoZminnqprdJmm6KrkaW9sLXNrZydZZ6etKa%2ByJqlrGWamrSiew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./presidential-panel-asks-buhari-to-sack-magu-appoint-new-efcc-boss.html><span>←</span><span>Presidential Panel Asks Buhari To Sack Magu, Appoint New EFCC Boss</span></a>
