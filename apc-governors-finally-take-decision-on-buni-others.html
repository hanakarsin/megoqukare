The court has correctly ruled that in line with section 13.3 of the APC Constitution, the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee was constituted by the National Executive Council of the APC to act as the National Working Committee. This ruling is consistent with the legal advice available to APC in creating the Committee and we commend the Party’s legal team for the proper and lawful guidance.</p><p>“Governor Mai Mala Buni was appointed in acting capacity, on a temporary basis to temporarily carry out and fill in the seat of the National Chairman of the party pending the election of new National Chairman. This has settled conclusively that the APC National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and its composition is not in conflict with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is consistent with provisions of the Constitution of the APC.</p><p>“We congratulate all Nigerians, in particular APC members and supporters across the country. We celebrate this landmark judgment together with all APC leaders, especially President Muhammadu Buhari whose zeal to bequeath a democratic party built bottom up for the benefit of Nigerians. We congratulate our colleague, His Excellency Rotimi Akeredolu S.A.N. for the reaffirmation of his electoral victory, which has now ended all electoral disputes around the Ondo State 2020 Governorship election.</p><p>“We equally extend our appreciations to the APC National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under the able leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni for the commendable management of the affairs of the party, which has minimise distractions from the task of rebuilding the party. Under the Committee, the Party has continued to be strengthened and attract more Nigerians.</p><p>“Most recently, reports of the July 31, 2021, Ward Congresses from all parts of the country has demonstrated once more the commitment of party leaders and members at all levels to the process of rebuilding the APC. The congresses were highly successful.</p><p>“We appeal to all members and supporters at all levels to remain resolute and continue to support all initiatives of the APC Caretaker Committee under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49uZpqok2K0sMLEq6WoqqNis6q6wKWjsmWklrimecOemqKrmaS7brvNZpmupplivLW0xKuqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1209221-things-long-distance-boyfriend-warm-relationships-html.html><span>←</span><span>100+ things to say to your long distance boyfriend to keep the spark alive</span></a>
