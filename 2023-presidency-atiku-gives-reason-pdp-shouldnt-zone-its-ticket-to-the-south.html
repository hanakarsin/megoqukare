According to Atiku while speaking on Tuesday with members of the party’s Board of Trustees in Abuja, out of the sixteen years the PDP was in power, fourteen was used by the south, hence the 2023 ticket shouldn’t compulsorily go to the region again."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
