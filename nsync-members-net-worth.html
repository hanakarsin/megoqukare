Justin Timberlake — $250 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Justin Timberlake is undoubtedly the biggest star to emerge as a solo act from the demise of NSYNC. Going on to star in countless films, television shows, and ad placements as well as maintaining a remarkable solo career as a musician, Justin has certainly translated the fame that NSYNC afforded him into long-standing success in the entertainment field. As of the time of writing his net worth is roughly $250 million, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2.) Lance Bass — $20 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Justin isn't the only former NSYNC member to leverage his boy-band fame into multiple other endeavors. Indeed, Lance Bass has remained a part of the pop culture conversation despite the group's split and has gone on to take on a variety of other roles in the entertainment industry. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Lance's total valuation today is around $20 million, a sum that is attributed to his work as a dancer, singer, television host, author, actor, and producer.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3.) JC Chasez — $16 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>JC Chasez's career as an entertainer began long before NSYNC was even formulated. As a child, JC starred on The Mickey Mouse Club (as did Justin), but music grew to be his calling as time went on. Despite being an active member of NSYNC, JC still focused a lot of his time on solo endeavors, and as such established a successful career after the group disbanded. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he is worth around $16 million.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4.) Chris Kirkpatrick — $10 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chris Kirkpatrick has certainly done well for himself as a member of NSYNC and beyond as well. Despite taking a five-year hiatus from the spotlight after the group disbanded, he returned in full force in 2007, starring in the reality show Mission Man Band. In the years that followed, Chris worked on the likes of Gone Country, The Fairly OddParents, On the Line, Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!, and Dead 7. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he has a financial valuation of around $10 million.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5.) Joey Fatone — $7 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Joey Fatone's career flirted with stardom even before NSYNC took off. Directly after high school, he got a job working for Universal Studios, landing a role as Wolfie on the stage show Beetlejuice's Rock and Roll Graveyard Revue. Naturally, music took over Joey's life as NSYNC grew in fame, but he has since appeared in films (like 2002's mega-hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding) and taken on a variety of hosting gigs over the years, including for <a href=#>Impractical Jokers: After Party</a>. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, he is valued at around $7 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo8C6usJmpJ6lkpq%2FtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwak%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyson-fury-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tyson Fury - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
