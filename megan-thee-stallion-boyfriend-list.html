Megan basically confirmed their romance in February 2021 on Instagram Live when she called him "my boo."</p><p>Despite breakup rumors along the way, the two continued on, showing their love for each other on social media, with Pardi also standing by Megan during her ordeal with <a href=#>Tory Lanez</a>.
