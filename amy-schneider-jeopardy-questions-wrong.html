The queen in question is <a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>, who made history for being the first openly transgender contestant to qualify for <a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>'s annual Tournament of Champions, as well as the highest-earning woman in the history of Jeopardy! Unbelievably, the 40-time champion's stint on the long-running ABC game show lasted from Nov. 17, 2021, to Jan. 26, 2022, making her Jeopardy!'s second-longest winner. She's right behind <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>' 74-game streak, and right in front of Matt Amodio's 38-game streak.</p><p>With a vibrant personality, sophistication, and a genius mind, Amy became a bonafide celebrity for all the right reasons. She's the face of change, the face of diversity, but the Oakland, Calif., engineering manager doesn't solely want to be recognized for her identity.</p><p>‚ÄúBeing trans is an important, huge foundational part of my identity and also, not. I‚Äôm not going on Jeopardy! to be trans on Jeopardy! I‚Äôm going on Jeopardy! to try to win some money," she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Beast</a>.</p><p>And win money she did. After earning over a whopping $1.3 million, Amy was on her way. Prior to Jan. 26, it seemed as though nothing could stop Amy's outstanding reign, but she's only human. Here are some clues that stumped her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What 'Jeopardy!' questions left Amy Schneider scratching her noggin?</h2><p>Though she's practically a human encyclopedia, over the course of Amy's lengthy run there were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several clues she missed</a> ‚Äî we'd be frightened if she knew literally everything.</p><p><strong>Of the several misses, on Nov. 17, 2021, Amy chose to answer in the category BEVERAGE RHYMES.</strong></p><p>Her clue was: "Cessation of hostilities between fruit liquids."</p><p>Hilariously, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, Amy answered: "What ‚Äì no."</p><p>The answer was: "What is a juice truce?"</p><p><strong>On Nov. 23, 2021, Amy answered in the category BOOK TITLE MATH.</strong></p><p>Her clue was: "1956's Dalmatians minus 2003's People You Meet in Heaven."</p><p>Because quick mental math isn't easy, she answered: "What is 94?"</p><p>The answer was: "What is 96?" The books in question are 101 Dalmatians and Five People You Meet in Heaven.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jeopardy!

The funniest part is that these geniuses were even given a photo. Amy and her competitors hilariously remained silent.
