She says that a cosmetic procedure gone wrong has left her "unrecognizable."</h2><p>Although Linda was one of the biggest names in modeling for decades, she hasn't worked in the industry much over the last few years. The star gave some context into it all in a recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post. In it, she shared that she has become a recluse over the last five years due to a cosmetic procedure that went wrong, leaving her "brutally disfigured" and "unrecognizable."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Linda Evangelista (@lindaevangelista)</a></p></figure><p>Linda explained, "To my followers who have wondered why I have not been working while my peers’ careers have been thriving, the reason is that I was brutally disfigured by Zeltiq’s CoolSculpting procedure which did the opposite of what it promised."</p><p>She added that the CoolSculpting "increased, not decreased, my fat cells and left me permanently deformed even after undergoing two painful, unsuccessful, corrective surgeries."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Linda Evangelista says she developed paradoxical adipose hyperplasia, or PAH, as a result of CoolSculpting.</h2><p>Further on in the post, the model explained that the botched fat cell removal procedure resulted in her developing a condition called paradoxical adipose hyperplasia, or PAH. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthline</a>, nobody is quite sure yet why this can happen as a result of CoolSculpting, but it's typically more common in men. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox</a> notes that it is reportedly found in less than 1 percent of cases.</p><p>Although PAH is not life-threatening, it has certainly taken a toll on Linda's mental health, evident by her description of it in the Instagram message.</p><p>"PAH has not only destroyed my livelihood, it has sent me into a cycle of deep depression, profound sadness, and the lowest depths of self-loathing.

"I’m so tired of living this way. I would like to walk out my door with my head held high, despite not looking like myself any longer."</p><p>Representatives for Linda or CoolSculpting have not yet publicly elaborated on any further details regarding the lawsuit. As of Sept. 23, 2021, their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> had a disclaimer that includes, "Rare side effects may also occur.
