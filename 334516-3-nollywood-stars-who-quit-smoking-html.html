You would have noticed that I have not been that frequent in Movies for a long time. Even when I was a Special Assistant to our dear Governor, I was not in a good state of mind and this affected my work in the Government House, before I was advised to seek for a solution in Ghana. I spent so much money visiting hospitals, orthodox and unorthodox doctors without positive results. Until I was introduced to TB Joshua. I was only watching his TV program in Ghana and was healed. I put my faith into it just like the woman with the issue of blood and knew that I would be healed and I got my healing. I am now a mentally stable man. I have dropped the drinking and smoking habit.

Joshua and he was laying hands on people and praying for them. I love to watch his programs on Emmanuel TV. When he was praying, he said, ‘Lay your hands on the TV’ and I just laid my hands that day. I actually needed something else from God, not to quit smoking because I loved smoking! However, after praying I sat back and I think I slept off. When I woke up, I took a stick of cigarette and I felt crazy. I couldn’t even imagine that I took it up to smoke in the first place. It felt like poison!”</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHSAlGptZmtdo7ytuNiwpqicXajBor7SZq6hp12mwqrAjKykqKOZo7RvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./husband-only-counts-manual-labor-stressful.html><span>←</span><span>Working Mom Says Husband Only Counts Manual Labor as Tiring</span></a>
