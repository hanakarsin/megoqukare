She does it once more before a final image of the laptop launching across the ground and slamming into the side of the house closes out the video.</p><p>In a caption for the video she further clarifies how she feels about the company that fired her, writing: "I think the laptop was more than a fair trade #ihatecapitalism"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @lyssg717</span></figure><p>Viewers who saw the clip had a litany of different opinions on it, with one person writing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that it reminded them of this famous film scene</a>: "It’s giving Office Space vs the Printer"</p><p>Someone else in the comments section wanted to know how long she was working there that her firing elicited that strong of a response, they wrote: "How long did you work there?" to which Lyss responded: "3 yrs it was my first job out of college"</p><p>While another TikTok user thought the action was "more than fair," there were some folks who didn't think that it was necessarily the smartest move to make, like one individual who wrote: "They are going to take that out your last paycheck, that was silly"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @lyssg717</span></figure><p>However, Lyss says that she had already received her last paycheck from the company, but didn't rule out the possibility that they would send her an invoice for not returning the laptop after the fact: "My last paycheck has already been processed unless they’re sending me a bill"</p><p>Other folks had more subtle ways of getting back at their own companies for firing them, like one person who penned: "I just soaked it in water...and dried and put it back in the box..."</p><p>And there was one TikToker who said that they kept some of the equipment from their job as a form of "payback" for getting canned: "I kept my monitors and docking stations I’m getting something out of it"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @lyssg717</span></figure><p>From the sound of Lyss' response, it seems like she made sure to keep something for herself on her way out as well: "Yeah I have more office supplies but I needed to let out a little frustration"</p><p>Others offered up other helpful ways to get out of paying any potential bills that might come in the mail: "Just say someone stole your laptop out of your car. Gotchu"</p><p>This video evidence doesn't seem like it'll help though, here's hoping someone at the company didn't catch it. Either that or Lyss could just outright refuse to pay it and hope that the company forgets about it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa6qsIyonZ9llaK9rbvYnpxmrKKWwKmx0maaqKWglru6ecuap62noA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./franck-ribery-html.html><span>←</span><span>Franck Ribery - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
