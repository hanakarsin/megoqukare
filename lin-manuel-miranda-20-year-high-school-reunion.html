He arrived a bit early with his wife, Vanessa, who is also an alum of the same school though she was a few years younger. Despite his nerves, Miranda took a moment to appreciate his wife looking fine for the big party.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It was at a beautiful art studio in Queens.<br>So, yknow, the corner of 36th st, 35th Blvd, and 37th ave, or vice versa, Queens makes no sense</p>— 🇵🇷Lin-Manuel Miranda 🏳️‍🌈 (@Lin_Manuel) <a href=#>June 4, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We were coming in from vacation and got to Queens an hour early so we went to this place for a pre-show drink.<a href=#>@VAMNit</a> looked SLAMMIN, as she does, every day, Christ I’m lucky. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pd4GsA9pJx</a></p>— 🇵🇷Lin-Manuel Miranda 🏳️‍🌈 (@Lin_Manuel) <a href=#>June 4, 2018</a></figure><p>He assumed that back in school, Vanessa had no idea who he was.
