In the TikTok, she goes on to point out a plate with an omelette, marble rye toast, and potatoes on it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jeddamindtricks</span></figure><p>Obviously people wanted to know the "story time" behind Jedda's now-viral post, which she succinctly cleared up in a few comments on the same clip.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jeddamindtricks</span></figure><p>Jedda wrote that she reached out to the other woman, and as it turns out, the fact that the man was cheating was news to the both of them: "She’s asked me to not involve her publicly so I’ll keep her business bc she’s going through the same as me he lied to both of us..."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jeddamindtricks</span></figure><p>Jedda continued, "But basically neither of us knew the other existed & each got a different excuse when we confronted him after I found the pics & messaged her....But basically neither of us knew the other existed & each got a different excuse when we confronted him after I found the pics & messaged her."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jeddamindtricks</span></figure><p>The TikToker added in the comments that she found out her BF was pretty much cheating on her during the entirety of their nearly two and half years together: "It all only happened like a week ago but when her & I compared what we knew I realised he’s been cheating on me almost the entire 2.5yrs."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jeddamindtricks</span></figure><p>As many in the comments section suspected, there was some behavior Jedda's (ex) bf was exhibiting that made her suspicious to begin with: "He was being really suss & was away with friends so I looked through his IG follows & boom wish I’d found it sooner but he was playing perfect bf."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jeddamindtricks</span></figure><p>Other TikTokers remarked that they too discovered their S.O.'s were being unfaithful through social media.
