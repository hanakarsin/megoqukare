The first one asked her if she was OK. And before Shari could even read the second text, her phone lit up as she had an incoming call from her daughter.</p><p>"I answered the phone and she was like, 'Are you OK?'" Shari explained, perplexed by her daughter's worry.</p><p>Her daughter explained that "I love you" is not a message you can just send leisurely. "That's what you send when you're in trouble... like <a href=#>a school shooting</a>," her daughter told her.</p><p>Shari was absolutely floored by her daughter's response.</p><p>"I couldn't text my daughter in the middle of the afternoon to tell her I love her because she thought I was in danger," she said as she ended her video, adding, "F--- this s---."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Users in the comment section felt the mother's pain.

The results are gonna be horrible. They should all be getting therapy," read one comment.</p><p>Another comment read: "Got those messages from my kids a year ago.
