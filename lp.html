EFCC forfeited quarters as State House Complex at Mabushi.</p><p>Another N1.5bn was earmarked for the acquisition, renovation and rehabilitation of 2Nos. EFCC forfeited quarters as State House Complex at Guzape.</p><p>Speaking during an interview with the aforementioned publication, the spokespersons for the LP Presidential Campaign Council, and the National Publicity Secretary for the AAC, Yunusa Tanko, and Olorunfemi Adeyeye, respectively, said the move was proof that Tinubu’s administration does not care about the suffering of the Nigerian masses,</p><p>Tanko said, “Nigerians must resist this in its totality; not in the midst of hunger, poverty, and insecurity should anyone earmark such huge amount of money for the jamboree. However, we have earlier foreseen this; we’ve seen this before, and it has been interplayed.”</p><p>On his part, Adeyeye said, “The Nigerian masses must vehemently resist this ridiculous move by the Tinubu-led government to expend N3bn in renovating two properties seized from political thieves. Of course, the forfeited properties in question would have most likely been recovered from members of the same bourgeois class as the President whether in the All Progressives Congress or in the Peoples Democratic Party or any of their appendages.</p><p>“However, as we have always said, now is another good time for Nigerians to troop out and occupy the streets in protest against all anti-people’s policies by the Tinubu-led government ranging from fuel subsidy removal to increment in tuition fees across public tertiary institutions, amongst others.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGijqWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-green-html.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Green - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
