The Frozen actor is in talks to play Wayne Szalinski's (Rick Moranis) grown-up son Nick, who becomes a scientist and accidentally shrinks his kids.&nbsp;</p><p>If you remember, the 1989 film followed a similar premise and saw Wayne's kids and their two neighbors' children having to fight their way back to safety through the backyard — which included bugs, lawnmowers, and the family's dog —&nbsp;after they were accidentally shrunk down to the size of less than an inch and thrown out in the trash.</p><p>After 30 years, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, is still a movie classic. In honor of the reported reboot, take a look back at where the original cast of the film is today.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.

Jared Rushton (Ron Thompson)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Facebook</span></figure><p>Remember, it was next-door neighbor Ron Thompson's baseball that activated the shrink ray gun, which shrunk all of the kids.

Though, we all know there was NO earthquake...</p><p>Besides his role in the late '80s film, Jared is also known for starring alongside Tom Hanks in Big and in Overboard with Goldie&nbsp;Hawn and Kurt Russell.
