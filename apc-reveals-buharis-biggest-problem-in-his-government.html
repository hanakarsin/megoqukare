Even the President, the governors, Senate President and the Speaker are all members of the NEC. So, if NEC commits suicide, that shows there is no more party.</p><p>“Time has left Lai Mohammed behind and he can’t catch up with time.</p><p>“Lai Mohammed and his fifth columnists are the biggest problems of this administration. As the Minister of Information and Culture that is supposed to explain the policies and programmes, including remarkable achievements of this administration to Nigerians, Lai Muhammed has failed woefully. Whatever he says is considered as a lie. If not, Lai should tell Nigerians what has been his contributions in the last five years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5BwZpqok2K%2FpsLEmqOsZZKqtaK%2ByKxkm6GXnLK0wIypqaianJq6brXNZp%2Biq12cvLex0aeknqakZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nsync-members-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What Are Their Individual Net Worths Today?</span></a>
