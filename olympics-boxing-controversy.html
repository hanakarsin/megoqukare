By default, Imane prevailed in the bout, since Angela threw in the towel early. However, immediately following Angela's description of how much the blows hurt and information that resurfaced about Imane's past from a boxing championship, the controversy began.</p><p>In 2023, Imane was disqualified from the World Boxing Championships for having what were deemed advantages over the other women. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">International Boxing Association</a> released a statement that explained Imane was among the athletes disqualified at that time, though no one was tested for testosterone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Imane Khelif | ÿ•ŸäŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸÑŸäŸÅ üá©üáø (@imane_khelif_10)</a></p></figure><p>"The athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential," the IBA statement said. "This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors."</p><p>There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that claim, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia's Tass News Agency</a>, that IBA President Umar Kremlev said at the time of Imane's and another boxer's disqualification that "it was proved that they have XY chromosomes.
