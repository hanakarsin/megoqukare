This duck is judgey as hell. It knows our secrets and it's getting away with some of its own. But BuzzFeed News<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> reports</a> that this picture dates back to a meme from Russia that is generally captioned with phrases like "Beware. This muscovy duck is trying to seduce you."&nbsp;</p><p>That's so straight-forward! I personally did not find this duck overtly sexual, but maybe that's the difference between growing up in Russia and growing up in America.

Due to the bird's expression which people on Twitter interpreted as mischievous or sassy, it grew into a popular reaction image on the platform in late April, 2017. As of April 27th, 2017, there is no definitive name for the meme.""The picture of the indoutka comes from Russian site Kakprosto.ru. On Twitter, the image appears to have been posted first by @whomstami, who posted the photo with the caption 'Why does this bird look like she has the tea on EVERYBODY I'm crying,' gaining over 1,800 retweets and 4,100 likes."<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJmenrqiuNJoaWlpZ2R9dXuRcWaTqZhsnLZ70qGYnZ1dmcKkt4ymnKad</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trump-rat-nyc.html><span>←</span><span>It's a Bird!
