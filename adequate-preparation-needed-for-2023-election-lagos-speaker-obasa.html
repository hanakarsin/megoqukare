It is unfortunate that Nigeria operates fire brigade approach in some of our undertakings, especially as regards to voter education.</p><p>“As it were, political education is a prerequisite for enhanced political skills, knowledge and participation in democracy.</p><p>“Electoral violence and other factors such as cultural practices, family background, institutional and low level of political knowledge, no doubt, militate against political participation.</p><p>“The citizens for want of security, consequent upon electoral violence, develop aparthy toward political participation. Therefore, to maximize the benefits of political education programmes and ensure sustainable democracy in Nigeria, the government and other political education agencies should develop a pragmatic political education framework,” Obasa said.</p><p>He, however, advised that the responsibility of educating potential voters should not be left to the <strong>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)</strong> alone.</p><p>“Political parties, civil societies, religious and traditional institutions, as well as the National Orientation Agency (NOA) should also collaborate with the electoral body in this regard,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BxZpqclabCosDEZqernaCWv6LAyKilZqaVmrGmsIyfpqtlYmV%2FdHnEpZycrJmku264wKCmrGWjpbKit8SrZKiakaiucA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-everyone-leaving-twitch.html><span>←</span><span>Why Does It Seem like Everyone Is Leaving Twitch These Days?</span></a>
