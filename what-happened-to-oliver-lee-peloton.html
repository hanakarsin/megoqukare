For example, cycling instructors Steven Little and Jennifer Jacobs have long departed the platform, yet there is still on-demand content for both fitness influencers on the app as of this writing.</p><p>Oliver has also scrubbed any mention of his involvement with Peloton from his profile except for one (very adorable) video of him on the bike while his dog Charlee leaps up on her hindquarters.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Charlee bringing 5 seconds of pure joy on this foggy rainy sunday here in nyc üòÄ‚ô•Ô∏èüòç</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Oliver Lee</a> (@oliver__l) on Mar 29, 2020 at 6:53am PDT</p></figure><p>His profile pictures on social media, which showed him at one point wearing Peloton apparel, have been changed as well, but there is no word from him otherwise on his departure.
