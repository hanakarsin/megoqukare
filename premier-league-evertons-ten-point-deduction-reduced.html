Recall that the Premier League dragged Everton before an independent commission, to face a charge for exceeding the permitted losses by £19.5 million over an assessment period that ended in the 2021/2022 season.
After the hearing, the Independent body found Everton guilty of the charge and slammed them with a 10-point deduction on November 17, 2023, which looked like a development that would aid their relegation this season."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
