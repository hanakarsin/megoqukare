It even has Jack the Halloween Czar as the master of ceremonies leading up to the big Halloween event on October 31st from 5:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. He sounds kind of similar to Jack the Pumpkin King from The Nightmare Before Christmas and appears as a cloaked figure wearing a pumpkin mask.</p><p>You'll find the village decorated to theme with pumpkins, spiders and witches.

You can buy candy from Nook's shop for 120 bells each. The only issue is that you can only buy one piece of candy per day. On the day of Animal Crossing's 2022 Halloween event, you'll be able to go trick-or-treating with the other villagers. You'll want to make sure you're stocked up on candy. You'll need at least 15 to take full advantage of the event.

When you give the villagers candy, you will in return receive lollipops. After giving Jack the two candies, he now only accepts lollipops that you can exchange for Halloween-themed item recipes.</p><p>This is also the first year that players can craft the Spooky Cookies recipe, which was added to the game with the 2.0 update.
