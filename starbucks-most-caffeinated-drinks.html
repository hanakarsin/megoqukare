So, it's safe to say that drinking strong coffee is vital, in order to get everything done while simultaneously maintaining a small dose of mental sanity.</p><p>That being said, I've done us all a favor by ranking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starbucks' most caffeinated drinks</a>. So prepare for the ultimate rush to conquer that daunting daily to-do list.</p><h2>These are Starbucks most caffeinated drinks:</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Venti Double Shot on Ice</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starbucks Newsroom</span></figure><p>Alright y'all, we're coming in hot (er, iced), with the first drink on the list, which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Venti Double Shot on Ice</a>. According to Business Insider, the Venti-sized beverage contains not one —&nbsp;not three — but a whopping five espresso shots, which brings a full 375 milligrams of caffeine to the table.&nbsp;</p><p>That's right —&nbsp;it's abrasive, and it's undeniably delicious (I mean really, ice, espresso, and milk? What more could you ask for). If it's really just one of those days, this is what you need.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Nitro Cold Brew</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starbucks Newsroom</span></figure><p>Next up we have the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro Cold Brew</a>. Despite its rich and somewhat chocolatey flavor, a Grande actually contains a whopping 280 milligrams of caffeine, according to Starbucks. Wowza.</p><p>So, if you're in dire need of a major energy boost, this is definitely what you've been looking for.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Iced Blonde Caffe Americano</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Starbucks</a></figure><p>Don't let the shockingly sweet and smooth taste of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starbucks' Blonde Espresso</a> fool you — it is not a force to be reckoned with.&nbsp;</p><p>Boasting 255 milligrams of caffeine, per Starbucks, the Iced Blonde Caffe Americano is seriously dangerous. And it totally gives you the *umph* you need to conquer just about anything.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Caffe Americano</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starbucks Newsroom</span></figure><p>We get it — the Iced Blonde Caffe Americano is a lot to handle, so on a colder, calmer day, you might be looking for something a little less rambunctious. That's why the regular Caffe Americano is basically a dream come true.&nbsp;</p><p>Per Starbucks, it features espresso shots that are topped with hot water, producing a thin layer of what is called "crema." It results in a delectably rich cuppa, coming in clutch with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">225 milligrams of caffeine.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Latte Macchiato</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starbucks Newsroom</span></figure><p>If you're seeking out something sweet to warm your soul, on the other hand, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Latte Macchiato</a> is probably what you're looking for.</p><p>According to the Starbucks website, it features espresso shots that are slowly poured over frothed milk, making for a bold roasted sip. And a Grande also contains 225 milligrams of caffeine, which is pretty fantastic, if you ask me.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Cappuccino</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>The cappuccino is a total classic, let's be real — but Starbucks' version is a serious powerhouse.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starbucks Cappuccino</a> features dark, robust espresso which is layered with a smooth layer of frothed milk, and lucky for you, a Grande contains 150 milligrams. Definitely not too shabby.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Caffe Misto</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Starbucks</a></figure><p>For those who aren't about that espresso life, this one's for you.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Caffe Misto</a> features a one-to-one ratio of brewed coffee and steamed milk, per Starbucks, making for a delicious creamy taste. And with 150 milligrams of caffeine in a Grande, you'll still feel a major buzz.</p><p>Let's face it: almost everyone needs a little (or a lot) of caffeine to conquer the day, and these drinks will definitely get the job done. They're basically guaranteed to keep you awake, so prepare to feel that *wide-eyed and bushy-tailed* feeling we all know and love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGivsGumqSrXaK8tMCMnJifnpWeu6LAxJ1knaqZo7i0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frankie-jonas-html.html><span>←</span><span>Frankie Jonas - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
