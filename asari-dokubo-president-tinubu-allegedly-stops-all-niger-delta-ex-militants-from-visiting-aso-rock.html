You know the man Asari is a strong supporter and adherent of Mr. President. But the management of the fallout of his visit to the Villa was a nightmare to the Presidency.</p><p>“You can recall that he came out of the president’s office to lampoon the Armed Forces, accusing its personnel of being the arrow heads of illegal bunkering in the Niger Delta. He has been seen arrogantly going about with many gun-wielding youths, boasting about the prowess of his private army to deal with constituted authorities, including the military and a sitting governor, precisely Rivers State Governor, Mr. Fubara.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the special adviser on media and publicity to the president, Ajuri Ngelale said that he is not aware of the issue, let alone, the president’s directive on the matter.</p><p>“I have not heard any of such speculation going around within the State House. While we appreciate the desire for intriguing reportage, I think we should avoid speculative assumptions that have no verifiable basis in fact,” Ngelale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BuZpqrkae2brDOpKybp12lv6a%2FyJ2cp6xdqbavwcGuZJqknJq0prDLsmSsrJ%2BlwG6ty6Vkp6GXmr9usMSlq5plla16rrXLoquapqSoeqe%2BzqZkr6GjnsGqusZmmKynXae8pLeO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./261948-magufuli-atishia-kufunga-makanisa-ya-tanzania-siku-chache-baada-ya-kushinda-html.html><span>←</span><span>Magufuli atishia kufunga makanisa ya Tanzania siku chache baada ya kushinda tuzo la kimataifa</span></a>
