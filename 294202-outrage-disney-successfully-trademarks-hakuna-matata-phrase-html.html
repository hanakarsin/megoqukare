Imagine, If we were to go that route, then we owe the British royalties for everyone who speaks English, or France for when we speak French," the petition reads.<p class=align-left>TUKO.co.ke understands that the film producer publicised its intention to own the phrase in 1994.</p><p class=align-left>In 2001, it was published for opposition and in 2003, it was registered as a legal trademark.</p><p class=align-left>The phrase was used in its famous animation film dubbed as Lion King which was first aired in August 1994.</p><p class=align-left>The trade mark prevents anyone from publishing the Swahili word 'Hakuna Matata' without permission.

We can't even fight for Migingo. Now foreigners walk in and steal Kenyan brands and patent them for themselves. All the while we are too busy stealing to notice," twitted Lord Abraham Mutai."Hakuna Matata' is a Kenyan brand. Our Government has refused to fight for it because it is busy, rewarding criminals with hefty state jobs.
