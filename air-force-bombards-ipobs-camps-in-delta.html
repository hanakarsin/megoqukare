They come from Onitsha, Anambra State to regroup in Illah. We must tell them they are not welcomed in the state. Delta State would be hot for them. Once we identify them through the air, we shall make sure we send them parking and if care is not taken, deal with them the way they want.”</p><p>But the acting Police Spokesman, <strong>DSP Bright Edafe</strong>, described the tension in the area as a hoax.</p><p>Edafe said people were just spreading rumours, insisting that there was nothing like an attack in the community.</p><p>“There is nothing like that in Okpanam, the area is peaceful. If they hear gunshot, they will begin to speculate about what is not happening. I can tell you that what is going on in Okpanam is a situation issue which I will not discuss in public,” Edafe said.</p><p>It was gathered that the Air Force operation caused tension in Asaba, capital of Delta State especially parts of lllah community, Oshimili North local government area as a combined team of police, Army and Navy used helicopters to raid the area.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49rZpqhomKzsL7CnmSbp52XrrOw0magqaeSqHqkrcypqmahnmKxprjTmmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-saturdays-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Saturdays - Members, Ages, Trivia</span></a>
