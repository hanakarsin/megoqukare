Fans know he's the frontman of the U.K. indie/alternative band <a href=#>The 1975</a>, and also the son of British actors Denise Welch and Tim Healy. Unfortunately, those who are familiar with Matty also know he has weathered a few controversies during his career.</p><p>But why do people hate Matty? Let's take a closer look.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do people hate Matty Healy? He's been involved in a few controversies — some legit and some taken out of context.</h2><p>In late 2022/early 2023 a clip of Matty marching and making a saluting gesture during a The 1975 concert went viral for all the wrong reasons. Some called for his cancellation because he was doing <a href=#>what they perceived to be a Nazi salute</a> during the band's song "Love It if We Made It." It's unclear if this is what Matty intended.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The march in question happens as Matty is singing, "'I moved on her like a b---h' / excited to be indicted / Unrequited house with seven pools / '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thank you, Kanye, very cool</a>,'" (both of which are quotes from Trump). Seemingly, the song is actually calling out Trump for his misogyny and Kanye for his antisemitic comments and other questionable behavior.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@godownxsoftsound href=#>@godownxsoftsound</a><p>love it if we made it, lyric’s explained by matty healy <a title=the1975 href=#>#the1975</a> <a title=mattyhealy href=#>#mattyhealy</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - kc✡︎" href=#>♬ original sound - kc✡︎</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Another controversy involving Matty Healy centered on a BLM tweet.</h2><p>In May 2020, Matty tweeted in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. “If you truly believe that ‘ALL LIVES MATTER’ you need to stop facilitating the end of black ones," he wrote on the social media platform, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. Which in itself was fine.</p><p>However, he also included a link to "Love It if We Made It" because it's a commentary on institutionalized racism and police brutality. ("Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men / Start with misdemeanors and we'll make a business out of them.")</p><p>Many folks were outraged that Matty seemingly used BLM to promote his music. He deleted the tweet (and has since deleted the account as a whole), but some people decried his tweet as an insensitive money grab.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matty has also been called out for racial insensitivity on 'The Adam Friedland Show.'</h2><p style=text-align:left>In February 2023, Matty appeared on the podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Adam Friedland Show.</a> He, Adam, and co-host Nick Mullen spoke on many subjects that rubbed people the wrong way — including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offensive speculation about Ice Spice's ethnicity</a> and imitations of Chinese and Hawaiian accents.</p><p>“I just feel a bit bad, and I’m kind of a bit sorry if I’ve offended you,” Matty said during a The 1975 concert in New Zealand not long after the podcast appearance, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>. “Ice Spice, I’m sorry. It’s not because I’m annoyed that me joking got misconstrued. It’s because I don’t want Ice Spice to think I’m a d--k. I love you, Ice Spice. I’m so sorry. I don’t want it to be misconstrued as mean. I don’t mind being a bit of a joker … but I am genuinely sorry if I’ve upset them because I f---king love them."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>mocking ice spice was MY LAST STRAW for matty healy</p>— Paxton #SahodItaasPresyoIbaba (@slitheringmilk) <a href=#>May 12, 2023</a></figure><p style=text-align:left>Another offensive sound bite from The Adam Friedland Show described an incident that many say sexualizes the brutalization of women of color. The men discussed when a woman walked in on Matty masturbating to a hardcore porn website that's known for misogyny and racism.</p><p style=text-align:start>“She went back in and Matty, like, on his phone and then on his 77-inch OLEDs just got Ghetto Gaggers blaring,” Adam recalled on the podcast. “Thirty seconds after the hang, just hardcore pornography.”</p><p>"You're not exaggerating. It was 30 seconds, like, you guys were still waiting outside," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matty added</a>. “She came back in; I was already flustered. I was dressed as ‘guy who is jacking off,’ so I had, like, an untucked shirt, and I think it literally was Ghetto Gaggers on the TV — somebody just getting, like, brutalized. … And it wasn’t some cool-scene New York art girl [who walked in on me]. It was little Olive, who came in, like, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m just getting my water!’”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i have followed & listened to the 1975 since their debut. matty healy has been "the love of my life" for like a decade. i've defended him countless times & explained his satire/dark humor/the characters he plays; but i cant defend what i just read about "ghetto gaggers". i'm out.</p>— chelsea *succession & scream spoilers* (@_wwmhd_) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matty's past comments about Taylor Swift don't sit well with Swifties in light of their reported dating.</h2><p>A 2016 interview Matty did with Q magazine has been revisited in 2023 in light of reports that <a href=#>he and Taylor Swift are dating</a>. In the interview, Matty was asked if he was afraid of losing himself in the limelight of a public relationship amid rumors that he and Taylor dated in 2014.</p><p>The musician responded with, "Yeah, absolutely," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>. “And the reason I mention that is because if I had gone out with Taylor Swift I would’ve been, ‘F---ing hell! I am NOT being Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.’ You know, ‘F---. THAT. That’s also a man thing, a de-masculinating, emasculating thing.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@1975truman href=#>@1975truman</a><p>MATTY HEALY KISSED ANOTHER FAN LAST NIGHT DURING ROBBERS IN SAN DIEGO OMGGG!!😭😭 <a title=mattyhealy href=#>#mattyhealy</a> <a title=the1975 href=#>#the1975</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=the1975live href=#>#the1975live</a> <a title=concert href=#>#concert</a> <a title=the1975tour href=#>#the1975tour</a> <a title=robbers href=#>#robbers</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> @the1975</p><a title="♬ original sound - the 1975 🥾🌎" href=#>♬ original sound - the 1975 🥾🌎</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Still others hate Matty Healy because of his on-stage persona and bits.</h2><p>Matty is known for his wild on-stage antics. From kissing fans, to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pretending to masturbate</a>, to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sucking a fan's finger</a>, to eating raw meat, The 1975 frontman has pulled some controversial stunts in his performances. He's also a fan of doing bits that blur the lines of acting and reality.</p><p>Many folks not "in" on a particular bit have been offended by his band cutting him off onstage right before he seems like he's going to say something controversial. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I don't think it's a racist thing to say</a> ..." Matty said one time before the intro to "It's Not Living (If It's Not With You)" cuts him off. Another time, Matty said, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Asian people are like</a> ..." before the guitar riff drowned him out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@indiemixtape href=#>@indiemixtape</a><p>Perfect timing🤦‍♀️ [credit: @jord981] <a title=the1975 href=#>#the1975</a> <a title=mattyhealy href=#>#mattyhealy</a> <a title=concert href=#>#concert</a> <a title=concertvideo href=#>#concertvideo</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - indie mixtape" href=#>♬ original sound - indie mixtape</a></figure><p>Some also point to videos in which Matty seems to be literally the worst type of person.

Those who aren't familiar with his (and Amelia's) dry, sarcastic sense of humor might think he was serious about some of the things he said.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Matty Healy delete his Instagram account?</h2><p>In April 2023, Matty's official Instagram account @trumanblack was deleted. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He addressed the move</a> not long afterward at a The 1975 concert, explaining, "The era of me being a f---king a--hole is coming to an end.
