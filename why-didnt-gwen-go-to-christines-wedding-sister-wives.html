If you're dying for the juicy deets, don't even think about clicking away because we've got the scoop you've been craving!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why didn't 'Sister Wives' star Gwen go to Christine's wedding?</h2><p>In a candid livestream Q&A on Oct. 11, 2023, <a href=#>Mykelti Brown</a> opened up about who missed her mom's nuptials to David Wooley. When asked about Gwen's presence, she bluntly said, "No, Gwendlyn did not go to the wedding."</p><p>Curiosity piqued, and another viewer soon questioned whether Gwen's absence had anything to do with their brother, <a href=#>Paedon</a>, whom she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">famously called out in a viral clip</a> early in 2023.</p><p>"I honestly don't know. I don't know," Mykelti revealed to the viewers. "Gwendlyn didn't tell me why she wasn't there, and when she didn't show up, it was kind of a shock to me. I didn't know she wasn't going to be there."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Katie Paulson (@withoutacrystalball)</a></p></figure><p>Mykelti confessed that she finds it "tragic" that her sister missed the ceremony: "I don't know the reasons why. I don't know if there was some sort of… there could have been an emergency. There could have been nothing, who knows?"</p><p>"But it is sad," chimed in Mykelti's husband, <a href=#>Tony Padron</a>, with a solemn nod. "It is sad," Mykelti agreed, leaving us all wondering about the shocking no-show at the Brown-Woolley nuptials!</p><p>But fear not because the suspenseful wait for answers is finally over. After weeks of speculation, Gwen finally spilled the tea on October 14 during a Q&A on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a>. As it turns out, she was too busy to celebrate her mom's big day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Gwen said her absence had nothing to do with any underlying drama.</h2><p>Gwen staunchly defended her decision to skip the Utah wedding, citing an overwhelming schedule as the culprit. But here's the twist — her mom was totally on board with it. "She didn't mind; she took me off the guest list as soon as I told her," Gwen disclosed, putting any potential wedding drama to rest.</p><p>In Gwen's own words, "I was busy, lol. Lots going on with school and my house." She highlighted her hectic schedule, particularly with a chemistry class, before reiterating that her mom was well aware of her plans to skip the event.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by gweny b (@gwendlynbrown)</a></p></figure><p>To set the record straight, Gwen emphasized that her absence from her mom's wedding had nothing to do with TLC filming, her estranged brother Paedon Brown attending, a feud with Christine, or anything else except her unyielding commitment to school and home.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Sister Wives on Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim6esXZzEprqMoKZmrJ9isKm%2ByKyroqaVqHq4scOdoKefXai2tMDEq2SwoaaawA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./18208-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nollywood Yoruba Actor Otolo Is Dead</span></a>
