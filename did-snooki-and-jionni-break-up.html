"Nicole is the only one who hasn‚Äôt talked much at all about Jionni since after Snooki and JWoww. I know that he‚Äôs private and doesn‚Äôt want to be on the show the way Laurens and the other spouses like to be, but this literally does not shock me at all."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nicole "Snooki" üíã (@snooki)</a></p></figure><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> that they didn't think Snooki and Jionni were ever happy together.</p><p>"The Italy season showed they wanted different things and were different people. Then Nicole got pregnant, and being traditional, I guess she wanted to get married, have the big white wedding and dream family life. But she never seems truly happy to me in herself, it's all about the kids. When they get a little older, I think she'll leave Jionni."</p><p>Of course, fans could be reading into Jionni's post too much. As a matter of fact, the couple and their three adorable children recently spent time together by the Jersey Shore for some much needed family time. So, it doesn't seem like Snooki and Jionni will break up anytime soon, and this isn't the first time we've encountered these rumors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rumors swirled when Snooki revealed she and Jionni sleep in separate beds.</h2><p>During a 2022 episode of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Are Family</a> podcast, Snooki revealed that she and Jionni sleep in separate beds. Wait, what?! The 34-year-old reality star stated that she shares a bed with her daughter, and Jionni shares one with their eldest son, Lorenzo.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nicole "Snooki" üíã (@snooki)</a></p><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>"The hard part, I think with having more than one kid in general, is just trying to figure out times and making sure that you're spending a good amount of time with each kid and not just all together. Because I feel like that's important for every kid."</p><p>She continued, "And then my husband sleeps with my son, and the baby just sleeps in the crib ... so, I'm with my daughter a lot from sleeping, and then also I take her to cheer and then my son Lorenzo does soccer. I try and go there too, but it's the same time as Giovanna's practice and then they're in school and all of that."</p><p>Catch new episodes of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation on Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledKnpqijmWKur7CMo6Copp6eeqO%2BxJqiZq2g</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nilsa-prowant-due-date.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>'Floribama Shore' Star About to Give Birth</span></a>
