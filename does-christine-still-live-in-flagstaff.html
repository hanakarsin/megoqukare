But does Christine still live in Flagstaff in 2021?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>A decade ago, we were introduced to <a href=#>Sister Wives</a> star <a href=#>Kody Brown</a> and his wives — Janelle, Meri, Robyn, and Christine, who lived in the city of Lehi, Utah.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the series aired, the Brown family packed up their things and headed to Las Vegas, Nev., where they lived for years before they found a new home in Flagstaff, Ariz., but not all of Kody’s sister wives seemed thrilled about leaving their home state.</p><p>In a recent teaser for the Season 15 finale, <a href=#>Christine Brown</a>, Kody Brown’s third wife, revealed that she was fed up with her marriage to Kody and ready to move back to Utah. Does Christine still live in Flagstaff today? Or did she move back to Utah?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Christine Brown move back to Utah?</h2><p>In the Season 15 finale of Sister Wives, Christine Brown has a lot to get off of her chest. Along with telling fellow sister wife Meri that she cannot “do” marriage with Kody anymore, she also mentioned the idea of returning home to Utah.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it seems that, as of today, Christine did not <a href=#>move back to Utah</a>, the newest episode of Sister Wives proves that she was seriously considering it in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier in the season, Kody and his four wives took a trip to Utah to visit family friends, which triggered some very real feelings for Christine. She explained to her fellow sister wives, “When we were there, you guys all talked about Utah was home, and the mountains were home, and family was there. So I thought that you felt the same."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>She explained that although their plural lifestyle was not widely accepted in their home state, Utah will always feel like home to her. She added, “So when we went, I mean, it did feel like that, but it's just, it's home, but it's not friendly, is how I feel. I mean, there's a part of it that will always be home to me, always. But it's not friendly to us, and I don't know. I just don't know how to feel comfortable doing that to my kids."</p><p>It seems that quarantine has been especially hard on the sister wives since having to self-isolate in different homes due to COVID-19. Janelle empathized with Christine, saying, “I'm sorry, I just don't even know how to make this okay for you.”&nbsp;</p><p>But the fact remains that Christine is obviously unhappy in Flagstaff. Does she still live there?&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Christine still live in Flagstaff?</h2><p>Judging from her Instagram, it appears that Christine still lives in Flagstaff with her husband and fellow sister wives. In an Instagram post last August, Christine’s daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwendlyn Brown</a> shared a picture with her mom and siblings at what seems to be their family home in Flagstaff.&nbsp;</p><p>The caption read, “Here’s an update on our quarantine time! We’ve gone to the lake a ton and on a few hiking adventures recently. We like to spend time in our backyard, especially when it rains. And we watch a movie or an episode every night after our walk.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gwendlyn Brown (@gwendlynbrown)</a></p></figure><p>You can watch new episodes of Sister Wives Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ycn6uho6m2r7GMrKuipJxiuarCxGagp2WWoa6ov9OanZ8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-does-chris-harrison-wear-ring-on-right-hand.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Harrison Is Wearing a Ring...
