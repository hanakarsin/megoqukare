He leaves behind millions of mourning celebrities, fans, and longtime girlfriend Nancy Burnet. Now the question is, did he leave behind any children — either with Nancy or wife, Dorothy Jo Gideon?</p><p>The star is no stranger to the public eye, as he continued to remain in the spotlight and participate in <a href=#>The Price Is Right</a> even after leaving his full-time hosting duties behind on June 15, 2007. He also appeared in several commercials, and portrayed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Barnacle</a> on an episode of <a href=#>SpongeBob SquarePants</a> in 2015.</p><p>Bob may have kept himself busy over the years, but he also appeared to make time for Dorothy who accompanied him to several philanthropic events. Did he also keep busy raising children?

The pair met at Cathedral High School when they were 15 years old. Shortly after meeting, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob asked Dorothy to attend an Ella Fitzgerald concert</a>, and the two became inseparable afterward.</p><p>The two of them eloped while Bob was on leave from the military on January 12, 1945. Sadly, their marriage ended in tragedy. Dorothy died of lung cancer in 1981 at age 57. They opted not to have kids together.</p><p>"We didn't have time for children," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob told Esquire</a> in 2007. "I don't regret it, not when so many of my friends are having so much trouble with their children. I have thirteen ducks, and that's a lot of work."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Bob Barker have kids with his girlfriend Nancy Burnet?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/@AccessHollywood</a></figure><p>Bob did find love again after Dorothy's death. Bob met Nancy in 1983 at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an event at an animal shelter</a> in Orange County, Calif.</p><p>“I went over to her, introduced myself, and explained that I was trying to find a good home for the dog I had on the leash," he wrote in his 2009 autobiography Priceless Memories. "Then I asked her if she was married or single.”</p><p>Lucky for Bob, Nancy was “winding up a divorce,” and from that moment on, the two became longtime companions who promoted advocacy for animal rights. She gave a brief <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> about Bob's death that mentioned such advocacy.</p><p>“I am so proud of the trailblazing work Barker and I did together to expose the cruelty to animals in the entertainment industry and including working to improve the plight of abused and exploited animals in the United States and internationally," the statement said in part.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a></figure><p>Bob and Nancy were together for 40 years, and also welcomed no kids. Prior to Bob and Nancy coming together, Nancy also opted to have no children.</p><p>He is survived by by his half-brother, Kent, and half-nephews Robert Valandra and Chip Valandra, and half-niece Vickie Valandra Kelly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7yjecGaqaSdomK4qrDS</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apc-national-chairmanship-details-of-al-makuras-meeting-with-akeredolu-emerge.html><span>←</span><span>Details Of Al-Makura's Meeting With Akeredolu Emerge</span></a>
