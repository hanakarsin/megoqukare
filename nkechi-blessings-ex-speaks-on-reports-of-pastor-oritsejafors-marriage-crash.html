Before you share a story kindly spend a moment evaluating the evidence. Attaching our family name (Falegan) to infidelity is not only disgusting but abhorrence and totally unacceptable. Falegan families are known for their strong moral principles.</p><p>“I support good journalism but I will criticise stories that are poorly researched or downright misleading.</p><p>“Use your media literacy to discern and amplify truths that are backed up by good evidence.
