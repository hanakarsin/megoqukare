I said, ‘No, I don’t have; I won’t put government money into that type of thing because if I do it for Christians, I have to do it for Muslims, I have to do it for Babalawo (traditionalist), I have to do it for Sango worshippers. No.</p><p>“But he insisted. Again, persistence. I had no choice to agree to now become a fundraiser for the completion of the National Christian Centre and I did. I got people together –the rich, the not-so rich, the poor, the not-so poor and we raised money to complete the National Christian Centre. I don’t believe he has been given credit for that work because if he had not gone the way he did, may be that centre will still remain uncompleted till today.”</p><p>At the programme, he recalled how he met with the former CAN president to seek his support ahead of the 1999 presidential election but was rejected.</p><p>“I came out of prison and pressure was mounted on me to contest election as president. Initially, I resisted and I said how many presidents do you want to make out of me but the pressure continued to mount,” Obasanjo said.</p><p>“Then, I caved in. When I caved in, I decided to go round and one of those I visited was the Prelate of the Methodist Church in Nigeria, Sunday Mbang. I haven’t met him before but I made a courtesy call and I said, ‘Sir, I have come to see you’ but before I finished, he said, ‘I will not vote for you and I don’t know what you come here for’.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FxZrCgqWK2br7En6ysnZRiwbB5xa6lnWWTlrturtSio52hnpx6uLXToWSgp6apeq67zZ6wZqeSlsCiusmoZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-moonshiners-filmed.html><span>←</span><span>Where Is 'Moonshiners' Filmed?
