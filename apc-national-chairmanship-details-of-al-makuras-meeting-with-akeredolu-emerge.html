As one of those who believe in true democracy. As one of those who has championed the inner mind of the people when it comes to justice, fairness and just cause.</p><p>“We feel you have a role to play in determining and shaping how this party, APC, is put together, especially in this critical time of transition. We must ensure the continuity of the gains we have had from President Muhammadu Buhari.</p><p>“This is the motivating factor that has made me throw my hat in the ring to consider contesting the office of the National chairman. We must give this party a principle, a good policy and raise the hope of our people.”</p><p>He earlier commended Akeredolu for changing the face of Ondo State within five years, stressing that he has added value to the sunshine state.</p><p>Responding, Governor Akeredolu thanked Al-Makura for the visit, while describing him as a competent and committed party man.</p><p>Akeredolu said the APC must establish a core value that the party must be known for, adding that there must be a general understanding among leaders and stakeholders of the party.</p><p>He said: “One thing that comes out is APC value. We must be able to establish one, or else we are only just wasting time. What are our core values? Do we really believe in democratic principles?</p><p>“Even if we are going to have consensus, it is consensus and not ‘one person sensus’, so if we must have consensus then it must be consensus, and that is my own approach.</p><p>“Recently, there was a bye-election in Ondo state here, some people said they wanted to contest and I asked all of them to go and contest and whoever won would be supported by all. A young man that won I didn’t know him. Very very young. I have never seen him before.</p><p>“I would not know what would have happened if we had imposed someone on the people. So, the young man won the primary and the general election. So, we must establish our principles and core values, I stand by that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49wZpqok2K7osDIqKWapF2YtaK10aaYp6uYnr1usMStmKKko2K8p3nApWSmmZuqv6K%2FjKacnqyZo7Ruw8itn2aZm5q%2FprDOpaxmnZ2av6ixjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./48353-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dayo Amusa launches web-site, unveils a new set of sultry pics.</span></a>
