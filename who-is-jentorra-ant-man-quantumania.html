In an ironic twist, the scope of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gets bigger by going smaller in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. The latest Marvel film follows Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). In the midst of trying to reconnect with his daughter Cassie (Kathyn Newton) after going missing for five years, Scott and his loved ones are transported to the subatomic Quantum Realm."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She is a rebel leader of the Freedom Fighters who oppose Kang, who has long ruled the Quantum Realm with an iron fist. She later leads an army in an uprising against Kang's forces.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Marvel.com, actress Katy O'Brien was pleasantly surprised to discover that her character, who is relatively minor in the comics, got to play a pivotal role in the film.</p><p>"I thought it would be just a tiny, much smaller role," she admitted. "When I got to basically stick through the whole film, I was beside myself."</p><p>Katy even revealed that she contributed some input into how the character was portrayed. When it came to costuming, Katy insisted on having a cape in order to look more heroic. She was also incredibly excited to be a part of the universe.</p><p>"It was cool to sit there and exist in the same room as [the rest of the cast] and watch everyone crack jokes back and forth," she told Marvel.com.</p><p>Naturally, there is a fair share of similarities and differences between Jentorra on-screen and in the pages of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comic books</a>. In the original comics, Jentorra hails from the planet of K'ai and is a member of royalty. When her planet is in danger, she calls attempts to call upon the Hulk only to be met with the Hulk's violent son, Hiro-Kala. She later joins the Enigma Force in the fight to save her homeworld.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>She is more associated with the Hulk in the comics than with Ant-Man, but the film does take some cues from the comics in informing her character. Jentorra's home of K'ai is actually located in the Microverse, another name for the Quantum Realm in the comics, creating a precedence for Jentorra to be related to the Quantum Realm in the films.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKOdnqm8s77AZpinrF2irq950K6Yp6yloq6vtcA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-bandits-kidnap-niger-commissioner-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Bandits Kidnap Niger Commissioner (Photo)</span></a>
