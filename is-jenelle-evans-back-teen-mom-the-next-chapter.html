Sources alleged that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">production team was afraid to work with David</a>, which led to Jenelle's departure from the long-running reality show.</p><p>However, with reports of <a href=#>Jenelle's split from David</a> surfacing, it seems MTV is ready to bring her back into the fold. So, the burning question remains: Is Jenelle Evans back on <a href=#>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a>? Read on to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, is Jenelle Evans back on 'Teen Mom: The Next Chapter'?</h2><p>Alright, the moment you've all been waiting for: Jenelle Evan is coming back to the Teen Mom franchise! The mother of three announced her return on May 8, 2024, revealing that she will appear in the spinoff series, Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</p><p>In a photo shared by Jenelle via Instagram, she is seen seated in what looks like the pilot's seat of a plane, flashing a smile while taking a photo of the cameraman with her phone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Teen Mom (@teenmom)</a></p></figure><p>Fans can also catch a glimpse of Janelle in the show's new trailer, where she struts in slow-motion as her voiceover states, "I think it'll be good to have a fresh start."</p><p>According to MTV's press release for the upcoming season, Jenelle will not be returning as a full-time cast member. Instead, the TV personality will be making a "special appearance amid her divorce and life-changing moves."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A few 'Teen Mom' stars are upset about Jenelle's return.</h2><p>On May 6, reality TV guru The Ashley <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that some Teen Mom cast members are "very upset" that Janelle is returning to the franchise.</p><p>"Only a few cast members were aware of what was happening until that photo came out," a source told The Ashley. "Some of the girls are very upset that Jenelle is getting to be on Next Chapter, despite everything that's happened."</p><p>A production insider noted that slots on Next Chapter are highly sought after, and other candidates were under consideration. But, ultimately, Jenelle secured the job.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"Some of the girls probably saw it coming, though," another source commented. "They knew when Jenelle dumped David that MTV would come calling. But I think most of them assumed [Jenelle] would be put on Teen Mom: Family Reunion and not Next Chapter. To have her go right to [Next Chapter] is kind of a slap in the face to some of the other girls."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jenelle once declined a return to the 'Teen Mom' franchise.</h2><p>In 2022, Jenelle made a cameo in the first season of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter. During that time, she reportedly received an invitation to rejoin the franchise, which she declined.</p><p>On Aug. 23, 2022, Jenelle's manager, August Keen, disclosed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> that she wouldn't be returning to the Teen Mom franchise due to a contractual disagreement. MTV allegedly wanted to sign Jenelle to an exclusive deal, but her manager argued it would restrict other career opportunities.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m SO EXCITED to welcome back Jenelle to <a href=#>#TeenMom</a> ❤️ <a href=#>https://t.co/rXTkGwBz3x</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/u1CwduOzMK</a></p>— Briana Dejesus (@_brianadejesus) <a href=#>May 8, 2024</a></figure><p>Jenelle's manager also claimed she had a "new dynamic series in development, [but was] keeping the concept under wraps for now." He mentioned that the show would be "picked up by a major network," but that doesn't seem to have happened.</p><p>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter returns on Thursday, May 30, at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsSnnKWklWKyt63NrGSbmZOgerWxxKdkpqedYsGpsYynnLGsXZi1orzTnqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wike-apc-lists-projects-amaechi-attracted-to-rivers.html><span>←</span><span>APC Lists Projects Amaechi Attracted To Rivers</span></a>
