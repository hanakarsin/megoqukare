Like preach that button till it won’t lower anymore onto the hood of the car"</p><p>Someone else had the same idea: "I would’ve brought the ramp all the way down. 'Oops, sorry. There’s no way for me to stop the ramp on the way down'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mike_robb</span></figure><p>Someone else just couldn't understand why she didn't reverse her vehicle, especially because it didn't seem like there were any other cars behind her: "'oops my bad' & a quick reverse would have been so much easier"</p><p>Another viewer said that they had a similar experience, but with a driver who blocked their son's car because they needed to use the restroom: "Similar experience on Saturday. Guy blocked in my son's wc van made us wait for him to take a [poop emoji]. When he came back, 'You gotta go when you gotta go'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mike_robb</span></figure><p>And then there were those who questioned what the woman thought she was going to accomplish by spraying folks with Meyer's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all natural cleaner</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @mike_robb</span></figure><p>According to BankRate, road rage was a factor in 218 murders and 12,610 injuries over a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7-year period</a>.
