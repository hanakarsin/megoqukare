The pair rose to stardom in the 1980s thanks to their hit album “Paid In Full.” The record peaked at Number 8 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and paved the way for the group’s trailblazing career. “Paid In Full” sold more than 1 million copies, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Selling Albums</a>.</p><p>In 1988, Eric B. & Rakim released their sophomore album and later entered mainstream music. They collaborated with pop star Jody Watley for the track, “Friends,” which reached the ninth spot on the Billboard Hot 100. The group went on two releases to more albums, 1990’s “Let the Rhythm Hit ‘Em” and “Don’t Sweat the Technique” in 1991, but they split shortly after. Rakim opened up about the group’s demise during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> and suggested that jealousy was at the root of the breakup.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Years later, some fans are wondering where Eric B. & Rakim are and if the group will ever reunite for another album.
