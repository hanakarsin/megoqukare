In life’s journey, it isn’t how far. Still, how well, indeed though satan should buffet if trials should come, I have this blessed assurance controlling all situations and saying to me it is well with my soul. Certainly, it is well. I made my journey to the ancient throne of Ife with faith in my heart and love for the keeper of it.</p><p>“Few impressions I would love to correct. If anyone knows otherwise, they are free to come up with facts. Let it be known that this decision to move on did not come because his majesty is married to another queen. As many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him. There were side attractions, but it was never an issue.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49wZqinnp56sLKMop2eZaeauaS7zJ6qZqCZqHqvsdZmqK6dlaN6sLjOq6BmpZGntqK5jJqlmqOfYravwM5mq6GdXaWura3CnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jack-grazer-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jack Dylan Grazer - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
