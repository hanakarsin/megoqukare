Yes, the internet is taking over literature! And we aren't OK with it!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chaseleee href=#>@chaseleee</a><p>I’m scared. <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foru href=#>#foru</a> <a title=booktok href=#>#booktok</a> <a title=scary href=#>#scary</a></p><a title="♬ a mirrorball girl - aye loves vivi ☆!" href=#>♬ a mirrorball girl - aye loves vivi ☆!</a></figure><p>Clearly, neither is Chase. We remember the days of Little House on the Prairie and the Harry Potter series being the most exciting thing at the Scholastic Book Fair. But now, it’s full of internet-themed propaganda that upholds the world’s addiction to social media, gaming, and trending virality. Is that really OK?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Commenters debate that the Scholastic Book Fair always had questionable titles.</h2><p>While some people are truly horrified at the current Scholastic book fair options, others are quick to point out that the fairs from our childhoods weren’t as “literary” as we might remember. For instance, I remember always buying a Mary Kate and Ashley book — now those weren’t evil social media-inspired books, but they definitely weren't high literature.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Etsy</a></figure><p>A commenter wrote, “Besides the TikTok book, this doesn’t look much different from what we had.” Others remembered buying books about Justin Bieber, Minecraft, Miley Cyrus, <a href=#>Pokémon</a>, and boy bands.</p><p>Hilariously, on the other hand, the official Minecraft TikTok account commented, “The fact it’s an unofficial guide to Among Us and our Crewmates look like that is sending me.” Even Among Us doesn’t support this version of the Scholastic Book Fair!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@chaseleee</a></figure><p>The question then becomes … how far is too far? Scholastic Book Fairs may not have spy gear, mystery books, and LEGO Star Wars sticker books anymore, but they have the updated Generation Alpha version.</p><p>And in all fairness, we didn’t get to see everything available at the book fair! Perhaps they also had Magic Treehouse and Babysitter’s Club books — we doubt it, but it’s possible. I guess the scariest part is just how deep social media runs into America’s young people.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@chaseleee</a></figure><p>When I went to the Scholastic Book Fair, I wasn’t even old enough to have a cell phone, and now, kids are on TikTok! It may not be what we expected, but it’s the reality of 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLCpu8uaqq2hk2KvsLvKZp2aoaJiu7DD</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./412450-forgive-my-mother-daughter-woman-accused-killing-kiiru-principal-pleads-court-html.html><span>←</span><span>Slain Kiiru Boys Principal's Daughter Pleads with Court to Forgive Mother Convicted of Murder</span></a>
