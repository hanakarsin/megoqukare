Those who have tuned into <a href=#>Counting On</a> know that <a href=#>Anna and Josh Duggar</a>'s marriage has already survived multiple scandals. But could the child sexual abuse material (CSAM) conviction against Jim Bob and Michelle's eldest child be the last straw?</p><p>Let's take a closer look at how likely it is (or isn't) that Anna is divorcing Josh.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Josh Duggar do?</h2><p><a href=#>Charges</a> against Josh came after child pornography was found on a work computer located at his car dealership. On Dec. 9, 2022, a jury found <a href=#>Josh guilty on two counts</a>: One count for receiving and one count possessing CSAM. He is now facing up to 20 years in prison.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Anna Duggar divorcing Josh?</h2><p>It's difficult to say what the current state of their marriage is because Anna has remained pretty quiet on social media in recent months. However, the mother of seven doesn't seem to be planning to divorce Josh.</p><p>"Anna is standing by her husband as she always has," a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, following his arrest on April 29, 2021. "She even accompanied Josh to Fayetteville on Thursday so he could turn himself in to authorities."</p><p>It's worth noting, too, that Anna was present at Josh's trial, and she even allowed her kids to see him leading up to it.</p><p>This makes sense, considering Anna's previous statements about marriage following <a href=#>Josh's 2015 Ashley Madison scandal</a>. During Season 1, Episode 2 of Counting On, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna opened up about how the infidelity</a> had affected her — along with her thoughts about divorce.</p><p>"It's such a betrayal for a spouse to go through what we're rocking through," she said on the TLC series. "You know, from my heart, it was just like, 'How could this happen in our marriage? Josh was my first love. He's my one and only.'"</p><p>Anna continued: "I knew that my only hope was to cling to my faith because I know if I went off of what I was feeling, I would turn a mess into a disaster. And so I think in the stun and in the shock of everything, I was just praying, 'God, help me to know how to respond to all of this.'"</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>When asked, specifically, what her plans for their marriage were, Anna made it clear that divorce was not an option for her and Josh. "I know there are those that feel I have every right to walk away from this marriage, and I respect other people's views," she explained. "But in my heart, when I got married I vowed to God first and then to Joshua, 'for better or for worse, 'til death to we part.'"</p><p>Anna continued, "I pray that through all of this, that I would be an extension of God's love to Joshua — that I would love him and forgive him, and that I would wait patiently and allow God to work in our hearts. And my prayer and my heart's desire is for our marriage to be restored."</p><p>Following the Ashley Madison bombshell in 2015, Josh ended up going away for an extended period of time to a "Christian recovery program" to seek help. He did not appear on Counting On from that time forward, and the series was canceled in June 2021.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by A N N A D U G G A R (@annaduggar)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Of course, all of this was before the CSAM trial went down.
