Who are they? Where do they live? You know that a territory can also influence Nigerian native wears and dressing style. So here we go.</p><h2>Ijaw people</h2><p class=align-left>The Niger Delta part of the country is the native land for Ijaw people.

Thus, not only Ijaw ladies but also their men are proud to dress up in eye-catching items of clothing.</p><h3>Ijaw traditional attire for ladies</h3><p class=align-left>Ijaw ladies who are not married yet prefer dressing in a blouse, gele, and wear a wrapper on their waist.</p><p class=align-left>Royal women don’t like to wear a blouse. They prefer using 2 wrappers instead of just one. Besides, they place a cute bead-decorated crown on their head, and their traditional style always looks fashionable.</p><p class=align-left>It is difficult to imagine an Ijaw wedding without traditional outfits. Ijaw brides are dressed similarly to their grooms. Their traditional dress is usually sewn from the best materials. Besides, ladies are in love with coral or ivory beads (and these two colors overall) and can add a gorgeous head tie to complete their holiday look.</p><p class=align-left>Some brides wear a special celebration decor on their head. It is usually of cute golden color and decorated with colorful beads of blue, pink, purple and other colors.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt61d7psups88.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Check out beautiful Idoma traditional wears</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There are also beautiful ladies who choose to wear a beaded cap to match their other accessories.</p><p class=align-left>While most Ijaw ladies prefer wearing long wrappers to cover their knees, some follow the latest trends and turn their wrapper into a skirt with the length just above the knee.</p><p class=align-left>As we have already mentioned, all Ijaw ladies (just like other Nigerian women) are in love with coral accessories, especially on festive occasions. They wear bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and other cute little female things with just any traditional attire and for all possible occasions and events.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Nigerian native attire styles 2017-2018</p><h3>Ijaw male traditional attire</h3><p class=align-left>Nigerian clothing style mostly depends on the event it is used for.

Such clothes are believed to help honoring water spirits. This outfit is also comfortable for dancing to the drum beats.</p><p class=align-left>When an Ijaw man becomes a groom, his traditional attire looks even more impressive to outline the new status. It is true that marriage plays an important role in the life of every family, but the traditional attire still depends a lot on the financial opportunities of the family.</p><p class=align-left>For example, Ijaw men choose to wear beautiful coral bead for a wedding if they cannot afford more expensive accessories or just want to match the image of the bride.</p><p class=align-left>Rich grooms can afford to get an ivory necklace which looks truly beautiful.</p><p class=align-left>No matter how wealthy the man is, Ijaw male traditional attire for a groom is really impressive.
