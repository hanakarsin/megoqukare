This was clearly a woman who understood the gravity of the situation the United States is in currently.&nbsp;</p><p>Georgia's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">memorial page</a> was flooded with comments from people who didn't even know her, ensuring her and their loved ones that they would or already have fulfilled her final wish.&nbsp;</p><p>"I voted for Biden/Harris," one person wrote. "May God bless your soul and may you rest in peace."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"Rest in peace, Mrs. Adkins," someone else wrote. "My sincere condolences to your family. Your family must be justifiably proud of your spitfire final wish, and I am happy to play a small part by honoring that wish."</p><p>"She is one HELL of a woman who cares more about us than herself. I speak in the present because heaven is the legacy we leave. I have already cast my ballot for Biden, Georgia!!!!" another person wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>On Facebook, comments were similar, sharing condolences for Georgia's family along with words of thanks for using her obituary to spread that message. One person even said they would be donating to the Biden/Harris campaign in her honor.&nbsp;</p><p>Georgia's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">extended obituary</a> shares more details of her full and happy life. She retired after working for the West Publishing Company as a linotypist for 32 years. She belonged to a church, was a "brunch regular at the Downtowner Woodfire Grill," and she lived at the Timber Hills Senior Independent Living Apartments in Inver Grove Heights, MN.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>She was also a regular contributor to the Pioneer Press Bulletin Board; her user name was "ET's Wife," as a tribute to her late husband Eldon Thomas Adkins. One of her posts includes wise words about the symbolism of the hummingbird: "The hummingbird's delicate grace reminds us that life is rich, beauty is everywhere, every personal connection has meaning, and that laughter is life's sweetest creation."</p><p>Georgia is survived by three daughters, a son, two step-daughters, 17 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild. I think it's safe to say her legacy will live on for many years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc2sZKiamanCor7YZpuoZZ6kwW7Czq2cZqyiqrqx</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ivan-cantu-update.html><span>←</span><span>Jane Fonda and Martin Sheen Asked People to Help Ivan Cantu</span></a>
