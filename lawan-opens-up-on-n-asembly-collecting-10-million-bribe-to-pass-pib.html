That is funny, but also very serious.</p><p>“I really want to take this opportunity to make exceptions to those kinds of unwarranted, unprovable, false and fake information being fed to the Nigerian public and the danger people will face with this is you cause unnecessary damage to the reputation of people.</p><p>“I had to take someone to court because of this kind of thing about three months ago, but Nigerians are better judges than anywhere else. So, the freedom of expression is there, probably more than anywhere in the world, but I want to caution that Nigerians should always think positive about their leaders and their administration and their governments and if they have issues they feel very strongly about, let them speak the truth and we are prepared to make corrections that we feel should be able to make us do better.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FtZqWZp5a7brvPnqWsZaWlerC6jKdkmquVoq%2BtxYycpqWklZjBqrrGZmhpZZ2eua21zqdkm6qZl7JuwM5mp5qro2K9qq6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./256677-jamaa-asimamisha-harusi-akidai-bi-harusi-ni-mpenziwe-na-alimpachika-mimba-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jamaa asimamisha harusi akidai bi harusi ni mpenziwe na alimpachika mimba</span></a>
