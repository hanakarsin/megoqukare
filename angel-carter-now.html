If you were a fan of someone's and you wanted the world to know it, Angelfire was where you could pour all of your obsessions about this person, place, or thing. There were undoubtedly countless Angelfire sites devoted to members of various boy bands. Take <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heaven in Nick's Eyes</a>, for example — the Angelfire site that was all <a href=#>Nick Carter</a> from the <a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>, all the time, except for the moments it wasn't.</p><p>If this conversation is to be believed, then at some point <a href=#>Angel Carter</a> was interviewed by the host of Heaven in Nick's Eyes. Angel is the twin sister of <a href=#>Aaron Carter</a>, and the interviewer was mostly curious about what it was like being related to <a href=#>two famous entertainers</a>. According to Angel, their fame was not a big deal and things were still very normal. Unfortunately that changed. It stands to reason Angel has also evolved. What is she doing now? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@angelcharissma</a><p>Nick and Angel are the last two siblings left after losing Leslie in 2012, Aaron in 2022, and Bobbie Jean in 2023.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Angel Carter now? She is a mental health advocate.</h2><p>Since Aaron Carter's death in November 2022, Angel has been a staunch advocate for children's mental health. She is an ambassador for the Kids Mental Health Association, which, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its website</a>, is "dedicated to making sure all grown-ups who support children have access to expert-created resources to help kids’ mental health."</p><p>In April 2024, Angel went on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Mornings</a> to share that she planned on releasing previously unheard music from Aaron in the hopes of reaching others who are suffering. All of the proceeds from the album, titled "The Recovery Album," will go to the Kids Mental Health Association. "The good in this situation is that Aaron does have this platform and my family has this platform and I would like to turn this ship around and to really start helping some other people and to learn from our story," she said.</p><p>Although Angel recognizes her family's situation was different, she understands that one thing that connects us all is struggling. Angel witnessed her family change as money started to come in, but she was too young to do anything about it. As she grew older, Angel felt powerless because she didn't have the tools needed to deal with her pain. Now she's hoping to provide support and care for her own daughter, as well as other children.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Angel Carter doesn't just talk the talk, she walks the mental health walk.</h2><p>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> in April 2024, Angel shared that she has spent years in therapy "working on herself." Her healing journey did not begin with Aaron's death, though in her words, that "lit a fire inside of [her]." Beyond working on her insides, Angel is careful to surround herself with healthy people who are also actively working on bettering themselves. This is a far cry from a childhood that was "filled with emotional abuse, dysfunction and addiction," as she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in August 2023.</p><p>Angel's first experience in therapy was due to a rather unorthodox offer from her brother Nick. Angel was 18 at the time, and they were filming their reality show House of Carters when on the last day, Nick sat <a href=#>all of his siblings</a> down and asked which of them wanted to go to therapy. "I remember that day," Angel told E! News, "because I was the only sibling that raised my hand and took that offer from Nick." She has been in therapy since that day and is now committed to helping others find the same peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruosctmmpqqpJq%2FbrrOsA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./burgess-abernethy-html.html><span>←</span><span>Burgess Abernethy - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
